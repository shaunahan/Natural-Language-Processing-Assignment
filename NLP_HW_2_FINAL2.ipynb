fishing Guide look s for normally I hope you found my Guide Tips entertainingly informative or mildly educational May all Your door knobs smell of BIG Salmon and Steelhead Best Fish s Salmon River steelhead salmon fishing guide Randy Jones Randy what s the Very Very Best way to keep my rod from EXPLODING When I m fighting and doing battle with a BIG Salmon or Steelhead I m glad you asked Just hand me your rod and I ll land it for you har har Great after my sarcastic joke now I feel obligated to write the below for you 1 Rule Rods will easily explode on you when you put your hand ABOVE the cork hand grip for extra leverage on rod blank when fishing Sure on lil trout you measure by the inch it s never broken But how about a 30 plus pound Salmon River King Salmon Even a 10 pound Salmon River Steelhead will cause your rod to break explode if it s mishandled by you Don t blame the manufacture its your fault These fish are equal opportunity rod breakers And don t care how much or how lil you spent on your rod Rods are meant to be flexed fully So by placing your hand above the cork it isn t and it will EXPLODE 2 Check your ferrals thru out the day A ferrel is where the pieces of your rod join together No matter the price you pay for your rod they do come loose thru out the day By checking them every few hour s you should be ok If your ferrules are loose And your rod is doubled over on a BIG Salmon or Steelhead it will break Every time 3 Remember when your rod fell off the roof of your car Or got a nick in it from a split shot or lead eyes on your streamer Even if you do all of the above that nick is your weakest link I will guarantee you that is where it will break when your rod is doubled over when Salmon River steelhead salmon fishing In Closing When you drop your grandmas finest china on the floor it breaks Her china was not made to be dropped on the floor Your fishing rod is no different If you remember that your fishing rod is similar to your grandma s finest china And follow rules 1 and 2 you ll be ok Many anglers bring 2 rods when Salmon River Steelhead Salmon fishing P S If you ever hear several Gun Blast s down river from you during Salmon season Those are Rods Exploding This 100 tells you there is a Good push of Salmon running the river below you Soon to arrive in your spot Ye Haa There are numerous ways to present a fly bait with a fly spin rod when Salmon River steelhead salmon fishing This is one of the more popular methods used in the Great Lakes region Some well known fishing authors have written about it My friend Tom Rosenbauer mentions it in his Orvis fly fishing technique book Deep nymphing dead drifting drift fishing high sticking chuck and duck These are all terms I ve heard used to describe the same method Anytime you can make it easier for any species of fish to feed or strike anywhere in the world you will increase the odds of hooking up That s why this presentation technique is so popular when your Salmon River steelhead salmon fishing It works in every condition you will ever find on the Salmon river High low water cold warm water any species clear off color water fast slow moving water close in far out no room for a back cast crowded conditions etc You only want to lightly tap your weight on top of the rocks 3 light ticks is sufficient giving your rod tip a 1 2 in twitch when feeling a slight pause stop or hesitation Many times the steelhead or salmon do not slam your flies or bait but instead mouth it before spitting it out This feel s like a pause or hesitation while you are on your Salmon River drift In my opinion it is critical to concentrate on detecting the pause or hesitation that happens when a fish lightly pick s up your bait or fly Pre setting the hook immediately before it has a chance to spit it is critical while you are checking to see if it is a rock or fish If you slightly twitch the tip of the rod 3 4 inch s on the pause then you are pre setting correctly If it s a rock you have just gotten over it and kept your fly bait on the bottom If you fully set then a lot of the time you have moved you weight and fly bait so far off the bottom that your drift is over If its a fish or a snag then your line will not move and stop which means you should immediately fully set the hook I pre set the hook with a twitch then set if line remains still when Salmon River steelhead salmon fishing The first lesson I was ever taught when Salmon River steelhead salmon fishing using this technique was If you pre set on the pause or hesitation and pull up a leaf then you are detecting the slight pause or hesitation correctly If you wait every time for your line to stop before you set then you are missing fish I always tell my clients when in doubt pre set the hook and if the line doesn t move PLEASE politely set it Not a day goes by when you can watch other Salmon River anglers fishing for Salmon or Steelhead and see there line pause with no reaction by them Or watch the line stop dead for 3 4 seconds with no reaction The reaction to the take has to be immediate or fly bait is spit out Many fish are lost and simply never hooked up because many many anglers are all waiting for that BIG BANG of Fish On when Salmon River steelhead salmon fishing A blind man can easily detect the take when the fish slams it but it s the 10 of anglers that catch 90 of the fish that are concentrating mostly on the pauses and hesitations in my opinion Pauses and hesitations 1 Watching the line in the water as it moves down stream on the drift You will normally always see it before you feel it 2 Feeling with your rod hand on rod grip 3 Lightly touching your rod hand index finger to line For a fly rod this will only work proficiently if the line is coming straight off the reel to your first rod guide If your in the habit of making those lil trout loops what I call them after you ve cast then it does not work 4 Holding the line in your other hand The line should be held in your fingertips for greatest sensitivity 5 There are some seasoned Salmon River steelhead salmon fishing angler s who don t watch their line in the water on the drift Instead they look at their rod tip through the entire drift Letting the slight movement of the tip tell them what is going on underneath the surface I sometimes change my weight 2 3 times without moving from the same spot I work the water close then farther out Weighting is critical to helping you detect the takes The key is to lightly tap the bottom not dredge the bottom Too much weight and detecting subtle takes is impossible and you ll end up getting stuck breaking off and re tying a lot Most Salmon River steelhead salmon fishing anglers use to much weight This technique also works in your local streams and river s for trout during high water conditions Also in the deeper faster sections were traditional fly lines will not allow you to get down to the bigger fish Basically their is no difference when you get a pause or hesitation from a rock salmon or steelhead that has just mouthed your fly bait Most anglers are all waiting for the big BANG Thereby missing 50 of actual takes If you think about it doesn t a pause or hesitation always precede a complete stop When a fish takes and spits your fly bait it can happen in a split second By concentrating on your line movement correct weighting depth of drift contact with the bottom pauses and hesitations You will be on your way too becoming a part of the 10 that catch s 90 of the fish Best fish s Salmon River steelhead salmon fishing guide Randy Jones Correct speed of drift Imitating an egg nymph dead drifting along the bottom at the same rate of speed as the bottom water column is imperative to successfully hooking up This is achieved by looking where you re mono enters the water It should be moving slightly slower than the surface current combined with a light ticking of your weight on the bottom rocks This matches the bottom current speed close enough Making your offering look real enough to even the Smartest Salmon River steelhead or salmon My primary goal when first fishing a Salmon River spot is NOT to catch a Salmon or Steelhead It s making sure my drift is fine tuned and perfect FIRST Only after this determination do I have any real chance of catching a Salmon or Steelhead I always guess approx how much weight I will need according to the depth and speed of water I m fishing combined with the distance I ll be casting I start every cast at the 12 O clock position 12 O clock is always straight in front of you straight across the Salmon River current My goal is to start lightly ticking the bottom rocks shortly there after with my rod tip high If I don t feel the bottom shortly after casting at 12 Then I ll cast the same weight slightly above up river the 12 O clock position My goal is to start ticking the bottom at 12 with my rod tip high If I achieve this my weighting is perfect If I don t achieve this then I know I ll need a lil more weight to achieve the perfect drift Once you ve achieved the correct weight and exact spot you need to land it in the water for the perfect drift It becomes imperative to your success to land your weight in the water in the EXACT same spot cast after cast Casting your weight to far up river or casting your weight to far down river doesn t work for numerous reasons when Salmon River steelhead salmon fishing In my opinion when drift fishing correctly the line between the tip of your rod and weight should be a straight line sub surface This can easily be achieved by holding your rod tip high on the drift by putting less line into the Salmon River water column If I held my Fly Spin rod tip low while drift fishing several negative things can happened 1 First and most importantly no Salmon or Steelhead are caught 2 A low rod tip puts more line into the Salmon River water column which creates a sub surface bow or slack in your line Causing your fly bait to unnaturally speed up and swing through the Salmon River hole instead of dead drifting through it There by making your tasty morsel look more like a speeding bullet than something that was naturally drifting along the bottom at the correct speed that was edible 3 The weight would not bring our fly bait into the strike zone due to the current bowing the line and speeding up the drift and keeping the weight off the bottom 4 When dead drifting the Salmon River correctly its imperative that you control your weight Most anglers let the weight control them With a low rod tip you are creating a sub surface bow or slack in your line and letting the weight control you Your weight is simply slogging along the bottom looking for the quickest and easiest Salmon River rock to call home for good By holding rod tip high you can control your weight by skipping over these snags with a quick 3 4 inch twitch of your rod tip when feeling a pause or hesitation 5 Usually if you have a subsurface bow or slack in your line you will not feel the weight lightly ticking the rocks sensation Due to the vibrations not being transferred up through the bowed or slack line to your rod hand or finger Which makes feeling the pauses and hesitations impossible Causing you to miss fish and getting snagged on the Salmon River bottom a lot With a high rod tip and a straight line from rod tip to weight you will achieve your desired and most productive dead drift Cutting down on drag giving it a more natural drift by imitating the correct bottom speed Feeling those pauses and hesitations better detecting the take better and getting hung up on the bottom less when Salmon River steelhead Salmon fishing To achieve a maximum dead drift and cut down on snags the rod tip should be held directly over the line on your entire drift When you feel a pause or hesitation and twitch your rod tip If its a snaggy rock you will pull your weight straight up and over it If you follow your line with your rod tip in front of the line or behind it many negative things happen The above articles all have some exceptions to them There are even more advanced techniques to add to the above articles that will further your success rate I guess I ll save those for my Salmon River steelhead salmon fishing guest s Happy Hook n Randy Jones Salmon River

       " ' 231 519 7348 Steelhead fishing is a popular sport for anglers They are a type of trout that provides challenge and thrill anglers live for Like trout steelheads are also hard to catch You have to use your best tactics to catch them One of the things that you need to catch a steelhead is the lure When it comes to fishing baits are everything Choosing the right bait will help you catch your trophy for sure You can also hire fishing guide service to help you catch the fish They also provide steelhead fishing reports which can help you plan your trip Fishing reports provide vital information like weather and fish availability The information can help you plan your next fishing trip There are many options to choose from Some baits are more effective than others When you are dealing with a cunning fish species like steelhead you need the best bait Here are some of the best baits to use for steelhead fishing Steelhead fish love hunting for roe otherwise known as fish eggs It s their natural instinct to kills the eggs of other fish This is an effective bait that will surely lure steelhead It is one of the most popular baits and guides and anglers agree on it Interesting thing about the steelhead is that they don t eat roe They destroy it as they don t want the predators to find the eggs The free floating eggs will catch their attention faster than any other bait Plus you don t really need the actual egg You can cure the fish eggs easily to use them as baits After the roe Spin N Glo are an effective bait for steelhead fishing They are designed in such a way that they spin in the slightest of currents This helps attract the attention of the fish as they can easily reach areas where it is hard to reach The bait can easily float right into the feeding zones of steelhead When fishing in areas that are narrow or tight quarters this bait can help attract the attention of the fish especially if they are hiding behind a log or boulder They are usually bright in colors and offers a great visual attraction You can also add single Salomon egg to it to make the steelhead pay attention Finding real Salomon eggs isn t always easy But there is a better option artificial eggs It has actually gained a huge popularity and many anglers used this to catch the attention of the steelhead They are naturally drawn to the eggs to bite and destroy them These artificial eggs are soft and not hard which is why steelhead don t let go They don t usually feel anything The artificial eggs are very flexible and you can add scent to it to make it more realistic to the fish Many anglers soak them in liquid krill as it does the job They are very durable as well and the fish bite doesn t destroy them They will last for a long time and you can use them multiple times Finding steelhead is very important and steelhead fishing reports can help you know how the fish are behaving This can also help you choose the right bait These are artificial worms designed to lure steelhead Pink color worms are considered as the most effective for obvious reasons The bright color easily catches the attention of the fish and baits it to bite You can also choose from various other colors like purple These are large worm like structure that wiggle under water and are easy to spot Steelhead will attack it either for feeding or destroying it Steelheads are very territorial and don t like intrusion So they will attack anything that comes close their feeding zone Beads are a great option for using as bait Put it an inch above your hook and float fish and see how it attracts the fish They come in various colors and sizes They are eye catching and very effective in attracting the attention of the fish Fish will attack it thinking either as food or intruder and the hook will then do the job It is an effective method and easy too Beads are effective for both trout and steelhead fishing Both fishes are similar with slight difference The beads are bright and attractive and work efficiently Using flashy spoons works too The flashy design and colors can both entice and annoy steelheads This will provoke them to bite It is a very effective method of catching steelhead You can easily get them online You can use spoons with feathers and wax worms This extra feature will only make the bait more effective It is an easy bait and you will surely attract a steelhead These are some of the baits you can use for catching a steelhead They are not easy to catch but with the right bait and technique you can easily catch them Make sure to check steelhead fishing reports before planning your trip Hiring a fishing guide will help you find and catch steelhead effectively It is more convenient to hire a service especially if you are a beginner Betts Guide

       " 'For COVID 19 related closures restrictions and updates see the WDFW COVID 19 Coronavirus response page Steelhead and rainbow trout are the same species but rainbow are freshwater only and steelhead are anadromous or go to sea Unlike most salmon steelhead can survive spawning and can spawn in multiple years Steelhead are highly regarded game fish and the steelhead is the state fish of Washington Steelhead can weigh 40 pounds or more but average between 8 and 11 pounds Steelhead also have dark spots scattered over the entire fish including the tail with slight to pronounced rainbow coloring Like chinook salmon steelhead have two runs a summer run and a winter run Most summer runs are east of the Cascades and enter streams in summer to reach the spawning grounds by the following spring A few western Washington rivers also have established runs of summer steelhead Winter runs spawn closer to the ocean and require less travel time They generally prefer fast water in small to large mainstem rivers and medium to large tributaries ',\n",
       " 'Throughout the eastern U S fall colors arrived behind schedule which scientists say is a sign of things to come Fall is a special time of year in the forests along the eastern seaboard as trees explode in brilliant shades of red and gold The air is crisp the days are still warm and the turning foliage offers an irresistible riot of color one that by one rough estimate generates as much as 30 billion a year in tourism revenue from Maine to the Carolinas The mountains here in general are gorgeous says Larry Deane a professional photographer who lives in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains outside Asheville North Carolina You combine that with vivid fall colors and it s just sort of magical But fall is getting warmer as a result of climate change This past October was the world s fourth warmest October in a 142 year record according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration That s no surprise The eight warmest Octobers have come in the last eight years And the Northeast which is most famous for fall foliages is warming faster than the rest of North America From Vermont to North Carolina fall foliage appeared behind schedule this year continuing a long term trend that according to one recent study of maples by researchers at George Mason University has pushed the appearance of fall colors back more than a month since the 19th century Temperature is not the only driver of that precipitation or the lack of it extreme weather and insect infestations all play a role As climate change affects all those factors it s making the timing of peak foliage harder to predict What s more climate related delays in leaf coloration are disrupting annual cycles of growth and rest that trees undergo What that means for forests how well trees grow where they can live and whether they can keep storing carbon at the same rate is still being sorted out by scientists We ought to be concerned potentially not just about timing of change for autumn but whether or not it portends some forest collapse says George Mason University ecologist Rebecca Forkner While nobody wants to be the sky is falling kind of person we do understand these changes are the plants telling us something is not right Like people trees must prepare for the cold dark winter All spring and summer their leaves produce a green pigment called chlorophyll that captures sunlight providing trees the energy to create the sugars and carbohydrates they need to grow and survive As temperatures drop and days grow shorter signaling an end to the growing season trees respond by ending chlorophyll production and absorbing any remaining nutrients in effect laying down stores for winter But lurking under that chlorophyll all spring and summer are orange and yellow hued chemicals which are unveiled as trees begin to go dormant In addition shorter colder days prompt some tree species including red and sugar maples to produce red anthocyanins Scientists think these red compounds are like a leaf s winter coat helping stave off the cold and allowing trees to absorb any last nutrients from the leaves before a cold snap kills the leaves The process leading up to shedding is known as leaf senescence Climate change is disrupting it in some species more than others with unknown consequences Plants have this amazing capacity to cope says Forkner but scientists don t yet know the limits of trees ability to adapt If they re not getting their nutrients back we could see some problems in our forest but it s too early to know We don t have enough people researching it In Maine s Acadia National Park scientists have noted a possible link between warm nights in September and delayed fall colors This is the biggest signal we have seen says Stephanie Spera an environmental scientist at the University of Richmond who is studying leaf changes in the park The whole season is being jeopardized I think it s getting a lot shorter Spring is starting earlier Everything is shifting In the past century the park has warmed by 3 4 F Trees and other plant life are feeling this change One out of every five plant species documented in the park a century ago can no longer be found today To gain historical perspective on changes in fall foliage Forkner and Alexis Garretson now a doctoral student at the Jackson Laboratory in Maine turned to herbaria the plant collections maintained by universities and other institutions Sifting through digitized records of maple tree leaves collected from the central and eastern U S and dating back to the 19th century they found that the first appearance of fall leaf color had shifted an average of about six hours a year since 1880 Over the course of more than a century those delays added up to more than a month Both of us expected to see a change and a pretty large one but both of us were surprised that the signal was so strong says Garretson The pair also examined the leaves for damage by pathogens or plant eating animals They found that the extent of damage has increased over time It seems to be associated with an increase in summer drought and also with leaves changing color later but falling off trees earlier Damaged leaves tended to fall as much as three weeks earlier than undamaged ones With temperatures staying warmer longer and with spring arriving earlier trees are experiencing longer growing periods with shorter transition times between warm days and cold frosts In effect fall is getting shorter One concern is that trees may not have a chance to finish absorbing the sugars and carbohydrates that remain in their green tinted leaves before the first winter frost The harm could come if you get a sudden freeze The trees may not be acclimated and the leaves may fall off before they ve withdrawn all their nutrients warns Howard Neufeld a biologist at Appalachian State University That could impact how well a tree grows in the following spring For a tree the color change process is how it goes to the grocery store and gets all the food it needs for next year says Forkner If it doesn t do that there are consequences for the lifespan How climate change affects trees in turn has a feedback effect on climate Forests absorb an estimated 30 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions released every year and if their health wanes so too might their climate benefits These ecosystems are buffering us from the worst impacts of climate change says Mukund Palat Rao a climate scientist at Columbia University s Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory who is monitoring the timing of fall leaves to better understand how changes might impact the carbon cycle If the ability of forests to do that decreases then what happens to the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere Rao says it s unclear just how much carbon trees can absorb a longer growing period may not equate to a bigger climate benefit One recent study of trees in Europe found as Forkner and Garretson did that climate change is causing some trees to drop their leaves earlier than they used to That could reduce the amount of carbon that forests remove from the atmosphere Very severe droughts or stress events makes the tree shut down more quickly says Paul Schaberg a Vermont based plant physiologist with the USDA Forest Service If it is just very very dry they ll drop their leaves in August Some trees may be more successful at adapting to climate change than others and as the less adaptable trees die and recede from the landscape fall colors may also change Trees that produce red pigments tend to have more northern ranges and some scientists speculate that the fall color palette could become more golden in southern latitudes Because of warming in New England sugar maples will shift north to find cooler temperatures Instead of Vermont maple syrup we might have to think of Toronto maple syrup says Neufeld For now falls will certainly keep getting warmer just like springs summers and winters This fall is not just a kind of one off exceptionally warm event It s part of a continuing trend we ve seen over the past several decades And that s what climate change is about individual events that are part of a longer term trend says Benjamin Cook a climate scientist at Columbia University This fall was pretty warm in New York In 30 years it might seem like a cold memory The annual ritual of admiring fall foliage is a good chance for people to reflect on that trend Neufeld says Fall has the best weather It s cool it s crisp out Fall color is big time tourism he says If more people get out and see nature and appreciate its fragility they might be more conducive to doing something to protect nature Copyright 1996 2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright 2015 2022 National Geographic

       " 'Sections Autumn blazes in these off the beaten path locations Jennifer Billock Travel Correspondent It s a typical East Coast tradition The weather cools the leaves start to change and people come out in drove to see the fall colors But the tried and true Eastern Seaboard is far from the only place to view the glories of fall brilliant hues can be seen across the country Greg Huse arborist at the Smithsonian Gardens in Washington tells Smithsonian com that although trees with bright color changes are native to the East Coast they can be seen throughout much of temperate North America His favorites are sugar maples red maples and the callery pear tree I picked these trees because they all tend to get very deep and brilliant reds or oranges which makes for a striking contrast to their green summer leaves says Huse Some trees like sugar maple sourwood and sassafras can get several colors throughout the crown of one tree And make sure to take all the colors in while you can Huse says that though global warming hasn t interfered drastically with color changes yet it is expected to have a major effect on trees Warming temperatures and oftentimes associated dry conditions are causing trees to become stressed during the growing season Huse said This can lead to premature leaf drop before leaves begin to turn color Additionally these conditions make the trees more susceptible to insect pests and diseases which can result in loss of energy and vigor and premature leaf drop or death Eventually says Huse global warming may contribute to a complete change of the country s forest makeup some species that are particularly sensitive to change like the sugar maple may completely die out and other tree species that can adapt may migrate to colder areas Before any of that happens though there s still time to catch some colors at these unexpected places across the U S To help plan your trip use this fall foliage predictor for peak timing Charlottesville Virginia Peak Season Mid to late October At peak color the foliage in Charlottesville accentuates the area s rolling hills and nearby Blue Ridge Mountains with dazzling reds yellows and oranges Go above the city to Monticello Thomas Jefferson s home to get a breathtaking view over the surrounding forest The Virginia Department of Forestry publishes weekly fall foliage reports during the season so make sure to check that before you go last year s season won t necessarily be the same this year Lake Geneva Wisconsin Peak Season Late September to late October Located midway between Milwaukee and Chicago Lake Geneva has long been a lake destination for water loving locals But stay past the summer fun and into the fall and you ll be stunned by the colors surrounding the city s namesake Lake Geneva was once home to wealthy vacationers who hired top notch architects to design their getaways ensuring trees that showed fall colors for the longest possible time were planted on the property Drive the three mile Snake Road through the trees take a hot air balloon ride enjoy the leaves from the lake or go ziplining through the forest canopy Taos New Mexico Peak Season Late September to mid October The color in New Mexico s high country comes and goes quickly sometimes in the space of just a week but the yellows and reds against the mountains and dunes are a sight not to be missed Maples oaks beech and aspen trees light up the Southern Rockies Sangre de Cristo range Make your base in Taos where you can catch a leaf peeping train chairlift or car ride or go hiking through the colorful trees It s also the starting point for the Enchanted Circle Scenic Byway which can whisk you past unique scenery and plenty of leaves as you head to north central New Mexico For a less forested more unique view stop at Great Sand Dunes National Park in neighboring Colorado and catch the colors over a vista of rippling sand The Keweenaw Peninsula Michigan s Upper Peninsula Peak Season Late September to early October In the fall Michigan s entire Upper Peninsula blazes with fiery colors across the area s 8 8 million acres of forest But don t stop in the south keep heading north on Route 41 to the northernmost tip in the Keweenaw Peninsula Here the forests are even denser and more colorful surrounded by the ghostly ruins and legacy of a long ago copper mining dynasty The best drive is straight up Route 41 and into Copper Harbor Detour up to the top of Brockway Mountain for an expansive view of brilliant colors Mammoth Lakes California Peak Season Mid September to mid October Aspens are the most prevalent trees here on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada but cottonwoods and willows make a stunning transformation as well blanketing the region in red yellow and orange Tucked in between you can find pockets of evergreens all surrounded by granite walls and alpine meadows Because of the high altitude range colors can change constantly for nearly a month If you go in late September you can see the leaves from horseback on a multi day drive to warmer pastures Tennessee River Gorge Tennessee Peak Season Mid October to early November The Tennessee River Gorge is considered Tennessee s Grand Canyon and snakes its way through the Cumberland Mountains Among the bright fall colors from three different types of forest you ll find bald eagles ospreys blue herons belted kingfishers and wild turkeys Try taking a boat through the carved out gorge launch at Suck Creek or nearby Lake Tellico for 18 miles of brilliant colors on every side Moab Utah Peak Season Mid September to mid October Aside from aspens cottonwoods and other deciduous trees making the slow turn to brilliance the abundant sandstone rocks change colors here too Shorter days and angled fall light combine to give Moab s signature sandstone deeper more varied colors than usual Jamie Pearce manager of the Moab Adventure Center recommends a couple different leaf peeping routes the La Sal Mountain Loop Road Scenic Backway the Gemini Bridges Trail the Poison Spider Mesa Trail or the Moab Rim Trail Jeeps are required on all routes except the La Sal The Ozarks Arkansas and Missouri Peak Season Late October to early November Covering 1 2 million acres the Ozark National Forest actually has two peak leaf viewing times False Peak in mid October and True Peak in late October because the forest sits in three temperate zones For the most varied color go during False Peak but to see the entire forest ablaze with slightly fewer hues go during True Peak The Branson Welcome Center has put together four different leaf gazing tours in the area ranging from an hour walk to a four hour drive Eureka Springs in Arkansas is another great spot to see the colors It s surrounded by a historic

       " ' Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News The first private space mission to another planet could launch as early as next year carrying a robotic space probe to Venus to scan its clouds for chemicals essential to life The small robotic probe the first of a planned series of three called the Venus Life Finder missions is among the most ambitious of a growing slate of planned space missions happening outside not just the traditional government space institutions but also the handful of major companies most notably SpaceX and Blue Origin that have dominated the private space industry so far Space is becoming cheaper in general and there is more access to space than ever before said Sara Seager the principal scientific investigator for the VLF missions and a professor of planetary sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Construction of the probe s two pound scientific payload has already begun with funding from MIT alumni Seager said while the costs of building launching and operating the entire 100 pound robotic probe during its mission to Venus will be met by Rocket Lab an aerospace company based in Long Beach California Rocket Lab like much of the growing commercial space industry has focused on launching satellites into space The company has already placed more than 100 satellites into orbit using lightweight rockets launched from New Zealand s Māhia Peninsula and plans soon to launch rockets from its new launch complex on Wallops Island in Virginia A spokesperson for the company declined to answer questions about costs and funding of the VLF mission Mason Peck a professor of astronautical engineering at Cornell University and a space industry expert estimated it s likely to cost more than 50 million And while it s not yet clear how Rocket Lab could profit the company could be in line for contracts for other scientific space missions if it successfully operates a probe to Venus he said Although the VLF mission would be the first private probe to another planet it comes after other signs that private industry is moving into scientific space exploration The California based space fund Breakthrough Initiatives headed by the Russian and Israeli billionaire Yuri Milner announced its Starshot project in 2016 Peck is an adviser on that project Starshot is an estimated 100 million effort to develop hundreds of tiny light sail probes that could make the journey to Alpha Centauri the sun s nearest star in about 20 years instead of the tens of thousands of years that would be needed by the fastest probes that now exist Last year Breakthrough Initiatives also announced they d fund the TOLIMAN project a small private space telescope to search the Alpha Centauri system for planets which presumably could be destinations for the Starshot probes Robert Jacobson a space industry analyst and the author of the book Space Is Open for Business said there are similarities between the funding of space missions today and the earliest phases of the exploration of the New World which were paid for by wealthy monarchs There wasn t an early business plan There were a lot of unknowns he said So even if there s not yet a business case for Mars or for Venus you will start to see business cases for sending missions to these other places in the solar system whether for governments or for the private sector Seager said Breakthrough Initiatives funded an initial study for the VLF missions but it had no further involvement She said the small VLF missions would complement the much larger DAVINCI VERITAS and EnVision probes to Venus planned by NASA and the European Space Agency which will get there in about a decade Their main purpose will be to look for signs that Venus had oceans of water in the distant past That would mean Venus was once a lot cooler and that life may have evolved there although it would be impossible in the extremely harsh environment that exists there now But the VLF probes will be much less expensive than the NASA and ESA probes which means they can be built quickly and get to Venus much earlier Seager said The VLF probes will be designed to search for signs of life in the dense clouds of Venus about 30 miles above the surface where it s cool enough for water to condense although the clouds are known to be mainly sulfuric acid Although Venus is now one of the most inhospitable places in the solar system the temperature on the surface is hot enough to melt lead and the pressure of its unbreathable atmosphere is almost 100 times that of Earth s some scientists think it s possible that microbes could survive there by floating in the cloud layer That idea was reinforced with the announcement in 2020 that phosphine had been detected in the Venusian clouds a discovery that was interpreted as a possible sign of microbial life That announcement was met with some skepticism however with some scientists proposing nonbiological sources of the phosphine and others suggesting phosphine hadn t been detected at all But the team behind the phosphine detection has doubled down on its claim saying the phosphine signal it saw is real and that alternative explanations such as volcanoes on Venus wouldn t cause it Many of those scientists are now involved in the VLF missions including Janusz Petkowski an astrobiologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who s now the program s deputy principal investigator The phosphine on Venus is just one of the many anomalies that have been detected in the Venusian clouds over decades Petkowski said This discovery is just the newest mystery If all goes to plan the first VLF probe will skim the Venusian atmosphere for three minutes while scanning the surrounding clouds with a laser But the first probe won t look for phosphine instead the on board laser will be tuned to detect carbon based chemicals that are considered essential for life even in highly acidic environments like the Venusian clouds A search for phosphine and other anomalous chemicals could be part of later VLF missions Petkowski said Tom Metcalfe writes about science and space for NBC News 2022 NBC UNIVERSAL',\n",
       " 'Manistee River steelhead fishing is some of the best steelhead fly fishing in the Great Lakes maybe even the lower 48 states Anglers from all over the country travel to Michigan for Manistee River steelhead fishing The Manistee and other northwest lower Michigan rivers have steelhead in them from late September to well into May They are pursued with fly bait and lures of all types For many anglers a Manistee River steelhead fishing trip is an annual event Manistee River steelhead fishing is heavily influenced by the logging onslaught against our forests beginning in 1840 and proceeding until about 1900 During that time some 160 billion board feet of wood were harvested The wood was more valuable than all the gold found during the California gold rush From 1869 to 1900 Michigan was the number one wood producer in the United States Most of the cutting was done during winter when the logs were easier to move In spring because we had no roads or railroads to begin with the rivers were used to transport logs to sawmills The white pine logs were the most desirable because they floated better than hardwoods This has had a long lasting effect on Manistee River steelhead fishing and other Michigan rivers as well The floating logs tore up the river banks exposing huge sand deposits that ended up in the river beds reducing spawning habitat and biomass food production It also left a tremendous amount of wood in the rivers You still see thousands of saw logs in and around the river Adding to the amount of wood we deal with is the invasion of the Emerald Ash Borer that started in 2002 The entire Lower Peninsula basically lost millions of ash trees to this invasive species Manistee River Steelhead fishing has been very effected by this the last couple of years The dead trees are now beginning to fall in the river in large numbers They are altering steelhead runs and adding to the woody debris When I arrived in Michigan 28 years ago I was told that our rivers were too deep and the runs too short for conventional steelhead fly fishing Chuck and duck was born Essentially using lead and a thinner line to get egg and nymph flies to the bottom Lobbing lead versus fly casting To a great degree this was the number one method for Manistee River steelhead fishing While a very successful technique it is very limiting as to where you can fish due to our very woody rivers It also concentrated the fishing pressure because there were only so many places to do it When steelhead fishing behind spawning salmon it is by far the best method It also works well in those short deep runs Many anglers were searching for ways to catch steelhead with more traditional fly fishing methods We were also motivated to be able to fish more of the river Indicator fishing as a specialized way to nymph has began to take hold in the last ten years when fishing for Manistee River steelhead This setup is unique to the Manistee River and would not fish well in smaller waters diagram to follow Larger indicators using shot strings increases success Gets a fly or bead down quickly and keeps it there while you feed out line See the diagram to the right The set up starts by using an 8 to 20 gram float depending on how much weight you want to support Use float stops to control the depth of your fly by moving the float I put the float on 12 feet of 12 15 pound test fluorocarbon and put a swivel on the end On that line I put 2 4 larger split shot Size of shot is related to the size of the float To the bottom swivel I tie on a 14 18 inch section of 10 12 lb test fluorocarbon with a swivel at the end of it On this section I spread an array of split shot decreasing in size until I reach very small steelhead shot next to the terminal swivel About 18 inches of tippet connected to the bottom swivel and tipped with an egg fly or bead has me set up for the most effective method of Manistee River steelhead fishing We use beads nymphs and yarn flies The Rag Style Clown Egg is a deadly fly for Manistee River steelhead fishing It is available for sale at Orvis or if you like to tie your own check out the step by step video on our Youtube page We have also begun to use Alaska style beads as egg imitations Indicator fishing expands the fishable water tenfold It enables an angler to fish in the woody debris that lines the banks of the Manistee River Lots of anglers have swung flies through the years with limited success Manistee River steelhead fishing using the classic west coast swing lines and fly patterns was a tough proposition Fish were caught but not consistently We did learn along the way Swing anglers learned that traditional west coast fly patterns weren t effective Also that Midwest steelhead won t track a fly for a great distance 40 50 foot casts maximum Several things have happened in the last few years to increase our success A new Scientific Anglers Freightliner Skagit fly line works beautifully with 12 14 foot spey rods giving us a great swing with minimal belly We run 480 to 560 grain lines on 7 and 8 weight rods 10 12 feet of T 14 on the front of the Skagit line works well in the 4 6 foot water we typical focusing on when swinging for steelhead The second major breakthrough was in the flies we are using Pioneering fly tyer Kevin Feenstra has taught us the value of using large amounts of Flashabou on our streamers to get takes Examples are the popular Grapefruit Head Leech and The Perch Anglers also learned that warmer water temps equal larger lighter flies In colder water use smaller and heavier flies Cast your fly to likely areas quartering downstream Set your reel s drag lightly so that a fish can grab and turn with the fly before you set the hook If you lift when you first feel the bite you won t hook up This is a great way to keep from making this mistake Increased success has increased the number of anglers swinging and that has increased success exponentially because we have more time on water to develop flies learn new holding lies etc Steelhead techniques in the Great Lakes and the anglers using them have matured over the last twenty years Many more anglers are interested in the quality of the experience as much or even more than the numbers of fish hooked Swinging flies is the pinnacle of the quality experience The old saying the tug is the drug is the truth When 10 pounds of fresh steelhead grabs your streamer you ve achieved one of the top ten exciting events in fly fishing I hope you use this information to have a better Manistee River steelhead fishing

are new to steelhead or just want a really good laugh than keep reading I promise this is how it went down no way I could make this stuff up This report comes from two Colorado trout bums who over a few beers decided to jump on a plane the next morning and find out what steelhead fishing is all about So it begins We just finished our final day of the season guiding in South Park and wanted to go fish somewhere cool nothing against South Park but one month of that place is about enough We considered the lower Colorado maybe the Miracle Mile Williams Fork Reservoir inlet etc We were set on hitting the Miracle Mile for one day and the Reef for another until we looked at the weather forecast DANG Snow and wind is the last thing you want in a Wyoming weather forecast this time of year So on a wild hair we decided to call in a favor for some buddy passes and go somewhere really cool that we hadn t been before Red fish in Louisiana the White River in Arkansas Deschutes the Sacramento River Pacific Northwest Steelhead We looked at flight loads and the Pacific Northwest is what we dialed it down to since Spokane was the only flight we would get on Luckily the Grande Ronde runs right through Spokane or so we thought Actually it s about three hours south as we would soon find out after booking a hotel for three days in Spokane which we later had to eat Luckily they let us out of two nights of our last minute Priceline booking With a destination decided and a projected budget of only 250 a person hahaha for 3 days of fishing we were in panic mode grabbing skagit heads sink tips heavy tippet big streamers and everything else that we thought we might need for an area and fish we knew absolutely nothing about This is what 2AM crunch time looks like in a fly shop when two guides decide to go fishing At 3AM we finally called it a night so we could get 2 hours of sleep before heading to DIA to catch an 8AM flight to Spokane If we could do this one over the best thing to do would have been not to go to bed because as standby passengers you must check in an hour early to check bags Long story short we missed our free ride to steelhead country Still determined to make this trip happen we pulled out the laptops and found 200 one way tickets to Spokane on Priceline for an 11 30AM Departure At 3PM we were in our rental car cruising to the local fly shop to dig up whatever info we could find As a fly shop owner I know what it s like to be hounded for info only to have someone walk out with not as much as a thank you for good info So we made sure to make it worth John s taking the time at Silver Bow Fly Shop to give us some good info and some local insight on the area If you are ever in the area be sure to check out Silver Bow It is a first class fly shop with some great guys working there 200 later and a bunch of flies we were off to the Snake River Grande Ronde confluence to try some night fishing for steelhead We pulled into a lot with some campers not knowing where we were exactly and asked some guys what river we were next to The Grande Ronde they said which was good enough for us We found a run got all geared up froze our butts off for 30 minutes and got back in the car That was some wasted energy we will just leave it at that We checked into Motel 6 in Clarkston WA an hour north and called it a night at 12AM The next morning we got an early start and were on the Grande Ronde just north of Bogan s Oasis at 6AM Thirty minutes later we were back in the car letting our hands thaw out After 4 hours of throwing hail marry spey casts swinging flies and trying to figure out what steelhead water is or isn t we were starting to feel like this was a bad idea Driving along the Grande Ronde trying to decide what steelhead water is or more like what it isn t After fishing licenses missing a flight booking a hotel in the wrong town etc we were pretty well invested in this last minute trip to Washington and were not about to leave without catching a fish So we did what Colorado boys do best and what makes steelhead purists vomit nymph Just to see if there was actually fish in the water we were fishing because at this point we were lost We pulled into a new spot that seamed to make sense through our logic which was an obstacle in the river that would have to make the steelhead stop and think about their next move We found that spot and 15 minutes later Brandon hooked a fish that by the time I got there had just broke off Not knowing if we would catch another fish this was pretty heart breaking Two casts later Brandon came tight with another fish which we landed If not another fish was caught this was already a victory we caught a steelhead A couple casts later I came tight on one and landed a nice steelhead I had caught one which was good enough for me At this point I made a choice to swing flies for the remainder of the day We caught several other fish both ways and had a blast on the Grande Ronde What a remarkable river this is We headed back to Motel 6 feeling that this trip was already a victory so we decided that on our final day we would hit one of the bigger water systems in the area in search of a really big steelhead Even if we didn t catch one we had to try The morning once again began slow but once we found fish we found fish What we ran into we would later find out are called B run steelhead The fish were so stacked we could pretty much catch them at will using whatever fly or method we wanted This was the type of day people go years in search of and we found it on our first trip If this means we go the rest of our lives and never catch another steelhead I think I can live with that because it was simply amazing Cookie cutter 30 36 wild fish that swam 700 miles from the Pacific Ocean The power of these fish is simply unexplainable These are saltwater fish that spend most of their lives running from Killer Whales and all sorts of crazy specimens in the ocean Needless to say OX tippet and some little 5 7 weight rods is no match for them I broke two fish off that simply just out fought me Just when I thought I had them to hand they would make one last frantic run and break OX like it was hair against a jagged rock If I could do this one over again I would bring an 8 weight some saltwater hard tippet and a net Grabbing a ballistic 36 inch fish on the end of an 11 foot rod isn t for us amateurs An experience steelheader told me that steelheading isn t about statistics so I m not going to say hooked this many we landed this many and measure this fish at this length and weight I ll leave it at we hooked a lot fish lost fish we broke rods and we landed some fish that I will never forget as long as I live They say steelheading will ruin you and that you will never want to catch a trout in Colorado again I don t know about that I feel like I most definitely want to catch another steelhead Our experience finding fish and fighting fish all the time in Colorado is the only reason we caught fish on this trip So to that I say go fish no matter where it is or for what because when you do get a chance to do something like this you will be more prepared Having now done both here are our thoughts There is no doubt hitting a steelhead on a tight line swinging is way more challenging fun and rewarding than nymphing I would say do both until you get it dialed If we had another week to fish and the right gear to do it with we wouldn t even think about bringing a nymph to the river BUT if two days is all you have you have no idea if there is even fish in the water you re fishing you ve never fished for this species completely under equiped and are not with someone who has experience steelheading do what you have to do to find fish and then get picky about how you catch them I would imagine as we learn more about these fish catch more on the swing and pay the price to do so like so many do our attitude will change Above all else have fun Fishing is supposed to be fun so don t let someone tell you what is or isn t fun We will till you steelheading is challenging and it s fun Go with people you enjoy fishing with and make it a team effort not a competition Learn how to throw a spey rod it will serve you well around here as well and probably do some research before you head out You must be logged in to post a comment 106 Main

venturing into space since October 4 1957 when the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics U S S R launched Sputnik the first artificial satellite to orbit Earth This happened during the period of political hostility between the Soviet Union and the United States known as the Cold War For several years the two superpowers had been competing to develop missiles called intercontinental ballistic missiles ICBMs to carry nuclear weapons between continents In the U S S R the rocket designer Sergei Korolev had developed the first ICBM a rocket called the R7 which would begin the space race This competition came to a head with the launch of Sputnik Carried atop an R7 rocket the Sputnik satellite was able to send out beeps from a radio transmitter After reaching space Sputnik orbited Earth once every 96 minutes The radio beeps could be detected on the ground as the satellite passed overhead so people all around the world knew that it was really in orbit Realizing that the U S S R had capabilities that exceeded U S technologies that could endanger Americans the United States grew worried Then a month later on November 3 1957 the Soviets achieved an even more impressive space venture This was Sputnik II a satellite that carried a living creature a dog named Laika Prior to the launch of Sputnik the United States had been working on its own capability to launch a satellite The United States made two failed attempts to launch a satellite into space before succeeding with a rocket that carried a satellite called Explorer on January 31 1958 The team that achieved this first U S satellite launch consisted largely of German rocket engineers who had once developed ballistic missiles for Nazi Germany Working for the U S Army at the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville Alabama the German rocket engineers were led by Wernher von Braun and had developed the German V2 rocket into a more powerful rocket called the Jupiter C or Juno Explorer carried several instruments into space for conducting science experiments One instrument was a Geiger counter for detecting cosmic rays This was for an experiment operated by researcher James Van Allen which together with measurements from later satellites proved the existence of what are now called the Van Allen radiation belts around Earth In 1958 space exploration activities in the United States were consolidated into a new government agency the National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA When it began operations in October of 1958 NASA absorbed what had been called the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics NACA and several other research and military facilities including the Army Ballistic Missile Agency the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville The first human in space was the Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin who made one orbit around Earth on April 12 1961 on a flight that lasted 108 minutes A little more than three weeks later NASA launched astronaut Alan Shepard into space not on an orbital flight but on a suborbital trajectory a flight that goes into space but does not go all the way around Earth Shepard s suborbital flight lasted just over 15 minutes Three weeks later on May 25 President John F Kennedy challenged the United States to an ambitious goal declaring I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before the decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth In addition to launching the first artificial satellite the first dog in space and the first human in space the Soviet Union achieved other space milestones ahead of the United States These milestones included Luna 2 which became the first human made object to hit the Moon in 1959 Soon after that the U S S R launched Luna 3 Less than four months after Gagarin s flight in 1961 a second Soviet human mission orbited a cosmonaut around Earth for a full day The U S S R also achieved the first spacewalk and launched the Vostok 6 mission which made Valentina Tereshkova the first woman to travel to space During the 1960s NASA made progress toward President Kennedy s goal of landing a human on the moon with a program called Project Gemini in which astronauts tested technology needed for future flights to the moon and tested their own ability to endure many days in spaceflight Project Gemini was followed by Project Apollo which took astronauts into orbit around the moon and to the lunar surface between 1968 and 1972 In 1969 on Apollo 11 the United States sent the first astronauts to the Moon and Neil Armstrong became the first human to set foot on its surface During the landed missions astronauts collected samples of rocks and lunar dust that scientists still study to learn about the moon During the 1960s and 1970s NASA also launched a series of space probes called Mariner which studied Venus Mars and Mercury Space stations marked the next phase of space exploration The first space station in Earth orbit was the Soviet Salyut 1 station which was launched in 1971 This was followed by NASA s Skylab space station the first orbital laboratory in which astronauts and scientists studied Earth and the effects of spaceflight on the human body During the 1970s NASA also carried out Project Viking in which two probes landed on Mars took numerous photographs examined the chemistry of the Martian surface environment and tested the Martian dirt called regolith for the presence of microorganisms Since the Apollo lunar program ended in 1972 human space exploration has been limited to low Earth orbit where many countries participate and conduct research on the International Space Station However unpiloted probes have traveled throughout our solar system In recent years probes have made a range of discoveries including that a moon of Jupiter called Europa and a moon of Saturn called Enceladus have oceans under their surface ice that scientists think may harbor life Meanwhile instruments in space such as the Kepler Space Telescope and instruments on the ground have discovered thousands of exoplanets planets orbiting other stars This era of exoplanet discovery began in 1995 and advanced technology now allows instruments in space to characterize the atmospheres of some of these exoplanets A less belligerent but no less competitive part of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States was the

       " ' A veteran steelhead guide shares his approach to fall run fishing on the Salmon River and Lake Ontario tributaries Finding and catching more steelhead on the Salmon River or anywhere else for that matter starts with good planning and an understanding of your quarry Here are five tips to help you do just that When a steelhead enters the Salmon River it s on a mission To accomplish that it has four basic priorities food shelter deep water and reproduction While it may be true that a steelhead doesn t have a huge brain it s a master at accomplishing its mission while keeping these priorities in mind So to find and catch more steelhead an angler s approach must reflect an understanding of the priorities of this exciting fish Let s look at each item through the mind of a typical steelhead In other words let s think like a steelhead Simply put steelhead want to get upstream using the fewest calories possible while taking in as many calories as possible The need to store up energy and fat for the long winter ahead is a driving force for the fish Thanks to an abundance of high calorie junk food many of us are in an ongoing battle to keep the fat off struggling to eat fewer calories than we burn With the mission underway steelhead immediately focus on adding fuel for the journey So let s learn something about this priority As steelhead enter the Salmon River in the fall they are primarily hunting one thing high calorie salmon eggs The timing is perfect since those eggs have recently been laid by chinook and coho salmon on their annual fall spawning runs Salmon generally enter the Salmon River and other Lake Ontario tributaries in early to mid September though in recent years there have been more and more fish arriving as early as mid to late August As the salmon spawn the eggs are lodged in the redd Most become a delicious trail of food tumbling downstream ready to be gobbled up by hungry steelhead How does this help find and catch more steelhead By telling us to locate and fish typical salmon spawning areas especially the areas downstream If you see salmon spawning the last thing you want to do is disturb them by casting and trying to catch them If the overall health of the future fishery isn t a good enough reason to resist the temptation think about this If you disturb the spawning salmon and they stop laying eggs any steelhead feeding on those eggs will leave the area When a steelhead enters the Salmon River from Lake Ontario it has just left a huge body of water approximately 180 miles long 90 miles wide and over 700 feet deep The river is only about 13 miles long a couple of hundred feet wide and on average only a few feet deep Quite a change of accommodations Therefore except when in shallow salmon spawning areas steelhead tend to search for the deepest water they can find While they tend to congregate in deep pools when not actively feeding or moving upstream big deep pools like the Black Hole on the Salmon River are not always the best place to catch them Inexperienced anglers tend to hang around bigger deeper well known pools casting all manner of bait and lures using too much split shot heavy line and a general flair for distressing any steelhead trying to rest These anglers may be able to see fish but will rarely catch any If a pool has been disturbed other good places of shelter include fallen or overhanging trees undercut banks large rocks that create an eddy downstream turbulent riffles and bridges When moving upstream steelhead are like a train on a track but in the river the channel is the track Keep in mind that the fish want to move safely with as much shelter as possible Therefore they follow the deepest channel Many times the channel may only be a few feet or in some cases only a few inches deeper than the adjacent water but it is still deeper To most effectively target steelhead figure out where the channel is and concentrate your efforts accordingly There are several ways to locate the channel If it is safe to do so based on the water level wading across the river is a surefire way to find the deepest spot Use a wading staff to test water depth before moving forward and getting in too deep Carefully wade until you find the near edge of the channel If it s still safe to do so continue wading across the channel until you find shallower water the far edge of the channel You can also watch other anglers on each side of the river Many anglers stand close to the edge of the channel since they tend to wade as far out as they feel they can safely stand Looking upstream and downstream generally gets you a good idea of where the channel lies since the other anglers are channel markers Using more split shot than you would to fish cast a few feet ahead of yourself and note the approximate depth Next cast two feet farther Keep increasing the distance a couple of feet per cast until you find the deeper water With fluctuating water levels the next time you return to fish that part of the channel you may not be able to safely wade to the same area Although things will look different with a change in water level the channel hasn t moved Migrating steelhead will still be there so once you locate a channel make some mental notes of landmarks on each bank so you can identify the area under differing water conditions Most beginners either overestimate or underestimate steelhead when choosing their gear I ve seen anglers on the river with surfcasting outfits because the fish are big and others with short ultralight rods since steelhead are trout For spin fishing look for an 8 to 10 foot slow to medium action rod rated for 8 to 12 pound test line and a good quality reel with a smooth drag system Prices vary depending on the brand and quality but you should be able to get a reasonably good setup for 250 to 350 If you spend less chances are you will not be happy The first good size steelhead you hook into will smoke your drag on its way back to Lake Ontario Spool the reel with 8 pound test line and tie on a barrel swivel and then about three feet of 6 poundtest tippet Fresh egg sacs are the preferred bait fresh being the operative word Don t buy salmon eggs or sacs in a jar from a chain store Chances are they were chemically preserved a long time ago and have been sitting in a warehouse You can find fresh eggs at a local tackle shops near the river you are fishing For fly fishing use a good quality 9 to 10 foot 6 or 7 weight rod with a matching reel Line it up two sizes lighter than the rod weight because it s essential to get your fly to the bottom where the steelhead will be The most productive flies are egg patterns To make them appear as natural as possible you ll need to add split shot and get them bouncing along the bottom Adding the split shot exaggerates the weight of your fly line so starting with lighter line now makes sense since the weight of the shot balances out the weight of the light line As with spin fishing use 6 pound test tippet though in lower clear water I often drop to 4 pound test In higher murky water you can bump up to 8 pound test but never higher Whether spin or fly fishing you want a rod that is relatively long and somewhat soft to act as a shock absorber because of the need to use a light tippet This equipment summary is not to say you can t catch steelhead swinging streamers but that s a

launched into space are UCF alumni Nicole Stott 92MS and the late Fernando Frank Caldeiro 95MS For over 50 years the university has played a big role in educating future engineers administrators and space explorers something we will continue over the next 50 years and more Kennedy Space Center KSC the country s gateway to the universe is only 35 miles away from UCF s main campus Here faculty and students have the opportunity to partake in cutting edge efforts In fact UCF has had more interns than any other university at KSC The opportunity provides students with on the job training soft skills development and involvement in research Some go on to convert their internships into jobs after graduation As students look to the stars and see endless possibilities they re reminded how the discoveries made today and tomorrow impact future generations to come Founded in 1963 with the mission to provide talent for Central Florida and the growing U S space program UCF has been making an impact on our state our nation and outer space ever since The Florida Space Institute based at UCF is made up of researchers and educators from UCF in partnership with those at other State University System of Florida institutions Many of these researchers are tied to major space missions exploring Pluto Saturn the Kuiper Belt Mars the moon comets asteroids Jupiter and exoplanets UCF faculty are part of several NASA missions including OSIRIS REx and New Horizons But our faculty aren t the only ones doing research in space UCF alumni have also gone on to take giant leaps in the space industry with companies such as NASA Boeing Lockheed SpaceX and Blue Origin Experiments sent to space since 2019 aboard Blue Origin SpaceX and Virgin Galactic rockets NASA projects with UCF involvement as of

       " 'Search the Blog Washington has some of the best Steelhead fishing in the world Anglers come from all around the country to battle the Evergreen State s monster ocean going Trout There s no bad time to target them either with two river runs and a chance of saltwater action It s only fitting then that the Washington state fish is Steelhead Trout Trout fishing is great in Washington sure but what makes Steelhead stand out from the rest of the state s Trout species Where should you go to catch them and when Read on to find out all this and more Steelhead became the state fish of Washington in 1969 but they ve always been a favorite among Washington s anglers That s saying a lot considering you can also target five other species of Trout and four different species of Salmon here There are just a couple of the things that set Steelhead Trout above the rest Steelhead are the same as Rainbow Trout but with one key difference They spend much of their life in the ocean then return to the rivers to spawn This means that you can target them in both saltwater and freshwater which opens up a huge range of ways to catch them Like the sound of wading through Washington s remote rivers with a fly rod in hand Steelhead will happily put you through your paces Prefer the thought of shore fishing in the Puget Sound You can still count Steelies among your many targets There s something for every angler s taste Even though they re ocean going most of the state s Steelie action happens in freshwater Washington enjoys two separate river runs which tag each other out over the course of the year Summer run Steelhead make their way into the rivers as adolescents and mature as they journey upstream Winter Steelhead are mature and ready to take on their spawning form when they hit freshwater That s great but what does it mean for me Put simply you can target Steelhead twice as often The winter run is in season November through March The summer run lasts from June through September Throw in the appearance of hatchery Steelhead in fall and you can fish pretty much year round if you re willing to travel to the right river Washingtonians are spoiled for choice when it comes to the state s game fish The rivers are full of Salmons and Trouts The sea is home to huge Lingcod Albacore Halibut and more Even so the state s Steelhead more than deserve their place as the Washington state fish They re big they re mean and they re around almost all year In short they re the perfect game fish Share this post with friends Gadge January 20 2022 Jan 20 2022 Hi I ve never been steelhead fishing I live in federal way and was wondering what was the best place close to me and specific dates on when it closes Notify me of follow up comments by email Notify me of new posts by email Δ Rhys Replied on January 20 2022 Jan 20 2022 Hi Gadge Thanks for reading and for your question While heading out to the Puget Sound offers the best opportunity for Steelhead fishing as they grow to incredible sizes here some of the smaller lakes in Federal Way are also stocked with Steelhead or Rainbow Trout as they re known when they don t head to sea Try North Lake in spring when over 10 000 fish will be stocked while around 8 000 will also be planted in nearby Steel Lake I hope this helps Tight lines Notify me of follow up comments by email Notify me of new posts by email Δ

Winter Steelhead runs can be excellent in your part of Washington but to make the most of it we d suggest visiting some of the spots that are about an hour away from Redmond That includes South Puget Sound especially Icy Creek Horseshoe Lake is another good location along with Grey Harbor If you don t mind a longer car ride you can try your luck on Wynoochee River which usually has excellent

on October 8 2021 Oct 8 2021 Hey Ray Fishing for Steelhead in saltwater during the fall can be unpredictable so arm yourself with patience when you hit the water Casting a line in one of the rivers and streams could prove to be much more productive Drift fishing from shore is your best bet use an 8 or 9 casting rod nightcrawlers salmon roe or sand shrimp as bait and bounce it gently along the bottom If you prefer lures bobber fishing with steelhead jigs and or soft plastics could work very well Fly fishing is more popular during the warmer months but it s still a challenge during the fall It s recommended to use either a spey or a switch rod and an assortment of wet flies I hope you have an amazing time fishing Area 8 Ray Tight email protected Notify me of follow up comments by email

       " 'Editor s note Hotels com was the exclusive sponsor of Fall Travel Week here at The Points Guy All content below is from TPG and wasn t subject to review by Hotels com This post has been updated with new information It s official Fall is here and if you want to see the leaves turn color you need to plan your leaf peeping trip now According to many reports fall foliage all over the country has been noticeably delayed this year meaning it s not too late to head out to some of the country s most scenic regions and see the seasonal hues For more TPG news delivered each morning to your inbox sign up for our daily newsletter The lack of vivid foliage in some areas is being blamed on heavy summer rains and warm fall days which is keeping trees greener for longer Meteorologist Matthew Cappucci told Fast Company this week that fall foliage might not peak for the next two or three weeks Earlier this season SmokyMountains com a tourism site for the region that also sells vacation rentals released its annual fall foliage prediction map The creators leverage millions of data points to forecast at a county specific level where travelers should go for the ultimate leaf peeping adventure Basically it s a tool that predicts the arrival of fall foliage using data points such as historical precipitation and temperature data forecasts leaf peak trends observations and model outputs from previous years Of course foretelling fall foliage is always tricky alchemy and we know the tool can t guarantee exactly where and when foliage will peak especially when unusual weather patterns occur Still travelers can use it as a guide to plan their trips just keeping in mind that the foliage may be a few weeks behind the prediction map Related TPG s safe travel guide How to minimize risk on your next vacation Fall foliage arrived first in northwest Colorado Wyoming and Montana in September with the cottonwood and aspen trees in Grand Teton National Park turning to gold September was also the prime time to visit Rocky Mountain National Park when the mountains were filled with the bugles of the annual elk rut But travelers may still be able to see late fall foliage in southern Colorado Minnesota Michigan and parts of Utah For travelers on the East Coast the leaves in many of the most popular leaf peeping states have already begun to turn though may not have reached their peak splendor Maine s Acadia National Park is a great place to visit during this time of year in addition to stunning foliage you could also see the sunrise as it first hits the U S from the 1 530 foot summit of Cadillac Mountain Vermont and New Hampshire are also great destinations for hiking and leaf peeping followed by apple picking and snacking on cider donuts The area surrounding Portland Oregon is renowned for its incredible scenery and much of Oregon s wild landscapes explode with bursts of color at every turn throughout the month of October and into November Take a steamboat ride and admire the changing leaves from the river or get in your car and drive the Columbia River Highway a stretch of interstate designed specifically for its incredible vistas October is also an excellent time to explore the Berkshires a mountainous region in Western Massachusetts between New York City and Boston Utah s national parks including Arches Zion and Bryce Canyon may be best known for their sandstone cliffs and gravity defying arches but they re also great places to enjoy the fall foliage this time of year Plus the autumnal light illuminates the red rocks spectacularly Related 9 of the best national parks to visit in the fall October is also one of the best times of year to see the fall foliage while hiking in the Adirondack Mountains of New York state and travelers now have more time to do so thanks to the unusually warm weather By late October travelers will want to turn their sights toward the Midatlantic states and the Southeast The area where the Smoky Mountains are located is one of the most beautiful regions of the country and the eponymous national park is where you want to be this time of year For the best views head to the observation deck at the peak of Clingman s Dome or consider one of the iconic scenic drives in the area instead such as Cade s Cove Loop Road the Blue Ridge Parkway or the Foothills Parkway By the time November arrives much of the country is usually past its peak according to the prediction map However there are still pockets of the U S showcasing beautiful foliage throughout the month and travelers can look forward to seeing splashes of color much later in the season in some destinations than is typical Consider Kansas and parts of Missouri for example such as a trip to the Lake of the Ozarks The maple oak hickory and ash trees along the 1 150 miles of shoreline will be reimagined in painterly hues in November though the American smoke tree which can become an almost electric shade of pink tends to peak much earlier Alternatively take a scenic drive through the country roads that wind through the rugged forests of the Ozark Mountains for even more imposing views Travelers can also head to the southern edges of Arizona and New Mexico for late season fall foliage which should peak in November And it is possible to see fall foliage in the American South too from Texas to Florida In the southwestern corner of Texas Big Bend is home to the nation s largest protected area of the Chihuahuan Desert November is a great month to camp hike and backpack Check out the Chimneys Trail which winds through a rock formation in the desert and the Santa Elena Canyon Trail which snakes along the Rio Grande River Another great place to see fall foliage in Texas in November is the Guadalupe Mountains where bigtooth maple trees erupt in a riot of color across the McKittrick and Pine Canyons Or if you want to go a little farther south consider a trip to the Kisatchie National Forest in Louisiana The area has more than 600 000 acres of woodland and most of the state could be at its peak in November along with central Florida In light of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic this is shaping up to be another major year for trips to national and state parks and scenic road trips across the country Though the fall foliage map can t make any guarantees it s a smart way to determine where and when you should plan your fall foliage trips this year Just remember to stay apprised of state and county regulations prioritize your health and safety no matter where in the country you plan to travel and be flexible with your plans especially with seasonal delays in the arrival of fall foliage It s also never been more important to protect your investment in travel so consider purchasing travel insurance and stick to flexible fares and rates that will allow you to cancel or rebook without penalty Additional reporting by Clint Henderson and Melanie Lieberman Featured photo

       " ' A steelhead trout swims in Eagle Creek Oregon The fish are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in the Columbia River Oregon Department of Fish Wildlife Flickr Record low numbers of summer steelhead returning to the Columbia River and its tributaries this summer mean there will continue to be limited fishing for the threatened trout Steelhead on the Columbia River are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act On Wednesday the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife said they would maintain pauses on fishing summer steelhead in the Columbia River east of The Dalles Dam and parts of its tributaries like the John Day Umatilla Walla Walla and Deschutes rivers into 2022 The next fishing season starts in January the Deschutes River is a popular place for steelhead fishing They are born in Columbia River tributaries swim to the Pacific Ocean for several years and then return to their rivers of origin to spawn The number making the return this summer was the lowest the Fish Wildlife Department has on record Just 70 of the summer steelhead forecast to make the run up the Columbia River past Bonneville Dam did according to the department The decline is due to a combination of factors like hydroelectric damming on the Columbia and its tributaries overfishing and climate change Record heat this summer severely impacted water temperatures for steelhead and salmon contributing to their decline Fishing for summer steelhead and salmon between The Dalles Dam to the Washington border has been closed since the beginning of September The closure followed a request by conservation groups worried about dwindling fish numbers Department officials said they are hopeful the numbers will improve in coming years due to a La Niña weather cycle that began in September and will continue into next spring La Niña is characterized by a low air pressure system that moves over the western Pacific Ocean It could bring cooler ocean temperatures and more rain and snow that could alleviate drought and improve conditions for salmon and steelhead in the Columbia and its tributaries Republishing Guidelines You must give Oregon Capital Chronicle credit

conservation groups worried about dwindling fish numbers Department officials said they are hopeful the numbers will improve in coming years due to a La Niña weather cycle that began in September and will continue into next spring La Niña is characterized by a low air pressure system that moves over the western Pacific Ocean It could bring cooler ocean temperatures and more rain and snow that could alleviate drought and improve conditions for salmon and steelhead in the Columbia and its tributaries Oregon Capital Chronicle is part of States Newsroom a network of news bureaus supported by

       " ' Sean M Gallagher grew up fishing steelhead He s one of hundreds of sport fishermen who spend hours on riverbanks seeking out the sparkling skin of rainbow trout known as steelhead Like some salmon they come back from the ocean in winter to spawn upriver But while salmon turn red and die when they return to their origins steelhead live for several years in fresh water and get bigger as big as 40 pounds while they are traversing regional rivers Gallagher a first time author shares the lures and lore of a Pacific Northwest icon in his new two volume book titled Wild Steelhead We asked him for a primer on the fish he loves so much 1 Steelhead Fishing A New Window Into Nature For many steelhead anglers it s not just about catching fish it s also an excuse to be close to nature says Gallagher When I m out there on the river it s like nature s cathedral It s a spiritual place for me a place where I can pray a place where I can feel comfortable and at peace And when the steelhead are coming back I have a sense that everything is right he said The sight of a white belly of a steelhead can fill you with life even on a cold dark winter day says Gallagher Things may seem like everything s dormant or dead said Gallagher but when you hook that steelhead and you feel the life you start to warm And if you get that steelhead in and it gets close to shore it s like it brings the sun with it and it warms you up And for those who choose to flyfish for steelhead there s the experience of being in the river among the fish For me I delight in the feel of the river pressing up against my legs and the coolness of the feel through the waders he said I like to walk through the forest and come to the river I feel like I can sneak up on nature 2 Where to Fish That s A Secret Most steelhead anglers don t like to share the location of their favorite fishing holes though steelhead can be found in local rivers The most skilled anglers learn all about the life cycle of the fish they re after as well as the patterns of the landscapes they inhabit Well paid guides know where to find them based on the water levels in the river and how it s running as well as temperatures and depth of water They choose bait or flies based on what they think would be naturally occurring at the moment or go flashy just to catch the steelhead s attention 3 Some Anglers Name Their Flies Fly fishermen are known to playfully poke fun at and or pay tribute to each other with the flashy bugs they assemble and attach to their lines in hopes of catching the attention of steelhead These creations are often named after their friends What happens I think is your buddy starts putting your name to that fly and pretty soon it sticks said Gallagher Gallagher for instance has Sean s Prawn which he describes as a variation of a fly that was made for Atlantic salmon fishing 4 Many Anglers Catch and Release These days sustainability minded anglers catch and release the wild steelhead they reel in Love em and leave em is a line you hear some of them repeat They may pose for photos with the catch but they then let the fish swim away Gallagher himself releases all steelhead he catches I think in this day and age that wild steelhead should be released I can t think of any place where we should be keeping em I wish that wasn t so because I think the best way to celebrate a steelhead is to actually take care in preparing it and eating it But we have salmon that we can do that with and we have some hatchery steelhead we can do that with he said 5 Once A Food Source Steelhead Runs On The Decline U S steelhead runs have dropped dramatically in the past century Just one hundred years ago more than 100 000 native steelhead spawned in the Skagit River Fifty years ago that number had diminished to 30 000 and now the run may be as few as 3 000 Steelhead fishing was once a source of food for people in the country Early settlers in the Skagit valley used to pitchfork steelhead in small tributary streams and filled wagons with them to use as fertilizer Now the estimated value of a sport caught wild steelhead exceeds 1 000 ',\n",

based on information gathered by the committee and the committee s deliberations Each report has been subjected to a rigorous and independent peer review process and it represents the position of the National Academies on the statement of task More than four decades have passed since a human first set foot on the Moon Great strides have been made in our understanding of what is required to support an enduring human presence in space as evidenced by progressively more advanced orbiting human outposts culminating in the current International Space Station ISS However of the more than 500 humans who have so far ventured into space most have gone only as far as near Earth orbit and none have traveled beyond the orbit of the Moon Achieving humans further progress into the solar system had proved far more difficult than imagined in the heady days of the Apollo missions but the potential rewards remain substantial During its more than 50 year history NASA s success in human space exploration has depended on the agency s ability to effectively address a wide range of biomedical engineering physical science and related obstacles an achievement made possible by NASA s strong and productive commitments to life and physical sciences research for human space exploration and by its use of human space exploration infrastructures for scientific discovery The Committee for the Decadal Survey of Biological and Physical Sciences acknowledges the many achievements of NASA which are all the more remarkable given budgetary challenges and changing directions within the agency In the past decade however a consequence of those challenges has been a life and physical sciences research program that was dramatically reduced in both scale and scope with the result that the agency is poorly positioned to take full advantage of the scientific opportunities offered by the now fully equipped and staffed ISS laboratory or to effectively pursue the scientific research needed to support the development of advanced human exploration capabilities Although its review has left it deeply concerned about the current state of NASA s life and physical sciences research the Committee for the Decadal Survey on Biological and Physical Sciences in Space is nevertheless convinced that a focused science and engineering program can achieve successes that will bring the space community the U S public and policymakers to an understanding that we are ready for the next significant phase of human space exploration The goal of this report is to lay out steps and develop a forward looking portfolio of research that will provide the basis for recapturing the excitement and value of human spaceflight thereby enabling the U S space program to deliver on new exploration initiatives

       " 'NASA aims to travel to the moon again and beyond Here s a look at the 21st century race to send humans into space Welcome to the 21st century space race one that could potentially lead to 10 minute space vacations orbiting space hotels and humans on Mars Now instead of warring superpowers battling for dominance in orbit private companies are competing to make space travel easier and more affordable This year SpaceX achieved a major milestone launching humans to the International Space Station ISS from the United States but additional goalposts are on the star studded horizon Private spaceflight is not a new concept In the United States commercial companies played a role in the aerospace industry right from the start Since the 1960s NASA has relied on private contractors to build spacecraft for every major human spaceflight program starting with Project Mercury and continuing until the present Today NASA s Commercial Crew Program is expanding on the agency s relationship with private companies Through it NASA is relying on SpaceX and Boeing to build spacecraft capable of carrying humans into orbit Once those vehicles are built both companies retain ownership and control of the craft and NASA can send astronauts into space for a fraction of the cost of a seat on Russia s Soyuz spacecraft SpaceX which established a new paradigm by developing reusable rockets has been running regular cargo resupply missions to the International Space Station since 2012 And in May 2020 the company s Crew Dragon spacecraft carried NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken to the ISS becoming the first crewed mission to launch from the United States in nearly a decade The mission called Demo 2 is scheduled to return to Earth in August Boeing is currently developing its Starliner spacecraft and hopes to begin carrying astronauts to the ISS in 2021 Other companies such as Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic are specializing in sub orbital space tourism Test launch video from inside the cabin of Blue Origin s New Shepard shows off breathtaking views of our planet and a relatively calm journey for its first passenger a test dummy cleverly dubbed Mannequin Skywalker Virgin Galactic is running test flights on its sub orbital spaceplane which will offer paying customers roughly six minutes of weightlessness during its journey through Earth s atmosphere With these and other spacecraft in the pipeline countless dreams of zero gravity somersaults could soon become a reality at least for passengers able to pay the hefty sums for the experience Apollo 1 Crew Apollo 1 astronauts Gus Grissom left Edward White and Roger Chaffee pose in front of the Saturn 1 launch vehicle at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida On the morning of January 27 1967 the crew was sitting atop the launch pad for a pre launch test when a fire broke out in their capsule killing all three astronauts The investigation into the fatal accident led to major design changes for future launch vehicles Moon missions are essential to the exploration of more distant worlds After a long hiatus from the lunar neighborhood NASA is again setting its sights on Earth s nearest celestial neighbor with an ambitious plan to place a space station in lunar orbit sometime in the next decade Sooner though the agency s Artemis program a sister to the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s is aiming to put the first woman and the next man on the lunar surface by 2024 Extended lunar stays build the experience and expertise needed for the long term space missions required to visit other planets As well the moon may also be used as a forward base of operations from which humans learn how to replenish essential supplies such as rocket fuel and oxygen by creating them from local material Such skills are crucial for the future expansion of human presence into deeper space which demands more independence from Earth based resources And although humans have visited the moon before the cratered sphere still harbors its own scientific mysteries to be explored including the presence and extent of water ice near the moon s south pole which is one of the top target destinations for space exploration NASA is also enlisting the private sector to help it reach the moon It has awarded three contracts to private companies working on developing human rated lunar landers including both Blue Origin and SpaceX But the backbone of the Artemis program relies on a brand new state of the art spacecraft called Orion Oldest Aircraft Photo Aeronaut John Steiner inflates his hot air balloon at Erie Pennsylvania as seen in the oldest known photograph of an aircraft a quarter plate ambrotype taken in June 1857 Get more aeronautics photos and facts in the National Geographic book National Air and Space Museum An Autobiography Currently being built and tested Orion like Crew Dragon and Starliner is a space capsule similar to the spacecraft of the Mercury Gemini and Apollo programs as well as Russia s Soyuz spacecraft But the Orion capsule is larger and can accommodate a four person crew And even though it has a somewhat retro design the capsule concept is considered to be safer and more reliable than NASA s space shuttle a revolutionary vehicle for its time but one that couldn t fly beyond Earth s orbit and suffered catastrophic failures Capsules on the other hand offer launch abort capabilities that can protect astronauts in case of a rocket malfunction And their weight and design mean they can also travel beyond Earth s immediate neighborhood potentially ferrying humans to the moon Mars and beyond By moving into orbit with its Commercial Crew Program and partnering with private companies to reach the lunar surface NASA hopes to change the economics of spaceflight by increasing competition and driving down costs If space travel truly does become cheaper and more accessible it s possible that private citizens will routinely visit space and gaze upon our blue watery home world either from space capsules space stations or even space hotels like the inflatable habitats Bigelow Aerospace intends to build The United States isn t the only country with its eyes on the sky Russia regularly launches humans to the International Space Station aboard its Soyuz spacecraft China is planning a large multi module space station capable of housing three taikonauts and has already launched two orbiting test vehicles Tiangong 1 and Tiangong 2 both of which safely burned up in the Earth s atmosphere after several years in space Now more than a dozen countries have the ability to launch rockets into Earth orbit A half dozen space agencies have designed spacecraft that shed the shackles of Earth s gravity and traveled to the moon or Mars And if all goes well the United Arab Emirates will join that list in the summer of 2020 when its Hope spacecraft heads to the red planet While there are no plans yet to send humans to Mars these missions and the discoveries

       " 'Skip to content Skip to main navigation Lake Erie s tributary streams both big and small receive an annual run of migratory rainbow trout called steelhead From October through April thousands of steelhead ascend New York s Lake Erie tributaries on their mission to spawn Excellent fishing opportunities await any angler who wishes to try their hand at steelhead fishing Between the acrobatic leaps long drag screaming runs and rod quaking head shakes the fight of an early run steelhead is a truly exhilarating experience It is no wonder that this steelhead fishery draws anglers from across New York surrounding states and Canada New York s Lake Erie steelhead fishery is supported by an extensive stocking program and natural reproduction Current NYS DEC stocking targets are 230 000 Washington strain yearlings that are stocked annually between 9 major tributaries In recent years the DEC has also stocked surplus Skamania strain steelhead in Cattaraugus Creek when available Stocked steelhead typically spend two years in the open lake feeding on smelt and other forage before maturing and returning to the tributaries as three year olds Besides steelhead brown trout and a small number of domestic rainbow trout are stocked into Lake Erie as yearlings These stockings supplement and diversify the harbor main lake and tributary fisheries In addition to stocking the steelhead population is further supplemented by natural reproduction in the New York tributaries most notably Cattaraugus Creek and its feeder streams The Washington strain is a winter run anadromous strain of rainbow trout steelhead derived from eggs imported from the state of Washington In Washington the native stock migrate between the Pacific Ocean where they do most of their growing and freshwater mountain streams where they spawn Similarly the naturalized Washington strain steelhead in Lake Erie utilize the lake for the bulk of their feeding growing and the tributary streams for spawning Mature Washington strain steelhead enter the Erie tributaries as early as mid September however the bulk of the run occurs from mid October through April The Skamania strain also originates from the state of Washington This anadromous strain is considered a summer run fish as they have the potential to enter streams earlier than Washington strain fish The DEC has stocked Skamania steelhead in Cattaraugus Creek since 2005 with the hopes of boosting the early runs by having fish enter the creek in late August through September A portion of stocked Skamania steelhead have a double fin clip adipose fin and left pectoral fin Steelhead in the Lake Erie tributaries generally average 5 8 pounds however fish up to 10 12 pounds are common so specific equipment is required Lighter equipment used for inland trout will simply not do Leave your ultralight spinning rod or 3 4 weight fly rod at home as these powerful fish can break lighter equipment In addition by using light gear there is also a tendency to overplay or completely exhaust the fish which could lead to delayed mortality The spinning rod and reel combo is the most widely used fishing gear so many anglers first try for steelhead using this combo Its versatility and ease of use are good reasons for its popularity A spinning combo works well for drifting egg sacs or casting spinners spoons and stickbaits At the very minimum a 6 5 foot long medium action rod combined with a spinning reel capable of handling 6 12 lb test line will work for steelhead Eight pound test main line is a safe bet for a combo like this More often steelhead anglers employ 8 5 10 foot rods with medium or medium light action that are rated for 6 12 pound test line These rods combined with a multiple ball bearing reel with a smooth but strong drag system and at least 150 yards of 6 8 pound test line is a good all around steelhead spinning combo Some anglers prefer to use a spinning reel with an ultra long and lighter action noodle rod which can be up to 14 long and rated for as little as 2 4 pound test line An advantage of noodle rods is they allow for delicate presentations of small baits on light leaders which is beneficial when fishing for spooked fish in clear water A longer rod also helps improve your drift by reducing slack and keeping more line out of the water Float fishing is a very effective method of catching steelhead and subsequently has become quite popular among steelhead anglers Also referred to as center pin fishing this method gives the angler better control over drifts and the ability to make much longer drifts than their spinning combo counterparts Rods are generally long between 11 5 and 14 feet long The center pin reel is the basis behind this technique These reels resemble fly reels but with a larger diameter The main difference is that center pin reels are free spinning with no drag mechanism Essentially the angler s hand acts as the drag when fighting a fish The spool sits on a central spindle and line peels from the reel smoothly when pulled by the stream current Center pin reels for steelhead should hold 250 300 yards of 8 10 pound test line Anglers can use 6 8 weight fly rods that are between 8 11 feet long to catch steelhead However a 7 weight 10 foot long rod is considered a good all around steelhead rod for the Lake Erie tributaries This size can be used effectively to dead drift egg patterns or swing streamer patterns Fly rods of 7 weight plus often come with an extended fighting butt which is helpful when fighting these powerful fish Fly reels should have a smooth adjustable disc drag system and have the capacity to hold the floating fly line and at least 100 yards of 20 pound test dacron backing Large arbor reels are ideal for steelhead fishing The larger spool diameter of these reels allows for quicker line retrieval reduces line memory and allows for a more consistent uniform drag Most steelhead anglers go with a weight forward floating fly line because of its versatility it can be used effectively for dead drifting with a strike indicator and also works well casting large streamers Tributary fishing is by far the most utilized and productive aspect of the Lake Erie steelhead fishery Any stream that empties into Lake Erie has the potential for a steelhead run The major Lake Erie tributaries such as Cattaraugus Canadaway Chautauqua and Eighteen Mile Creeks are the most popular among steelhead anglers This is due to the high quality of steelhead runs and the amount of public access on these streams Stream information and Public Fishing Rights Maps that detail public fishing areas are available for each of these popular tributaries Other tributaries such as Buffalo Cayuga Cazenovia Silver and Walnut Creeks receive good runs of steelhead however there is very limited or no public access on these streams In addition numerous small tributary streams or feeders to the larger streams can provide decent fishing To fish sections of stream that are on private lands you must have landowner permission Your fishing license is not a permit to trespass on private property Lake Erie harbors also offer steelhead and brown trout angling activity most notably Dunkirk and Barcelona Harbors Anglers can catch trout in these harbors from October through April however the most productive months are March and April Dunkirk Harbor remains a popular fishing site throughout the winter as a warmwater discharge from a power plant keeps the harbor ice free Sturgeon Point Marina Buffalo Harbor and the Upper Niagara River also have some trout fishing activity Starting in mid August steelhead begin staging in deeper water off the major tributary mouths in preparation for their seasonal run At that time trollers can target steelhead in 70 90 feet of water Spoons work well when run near the thermocline at 2 2 5 miles per hour The deep water bite can last through September As creek temperatures drop during September and October trolling closer to the creek mouths becomes productive as the first of the steelhead start to enter the creeks Also at that time wading and casting spoons near creek mouths or from the Cattaraugus Creek breakwall works well at dawn and dusk Lake Erie Steelhead Fishing Overview Map PDF ',\n",

       " 'Every autumn millions of people visit North Carolina to view the leaves as they change color from green into a mixture of red purple yellow and orange But this year s fall foliage might not live up to expectation as warm dry conditions persist across the state according to an expert at NC State I m not confident in saying we re going to have an above average year for fall foliage said Robert Bardon a professor of forestry and environmental resources and associate dean for extension at the College of Natural Resources Bardon added that the duration and vibrancy of fall foliage is mostly dependent on the weather between September and October with the optimal conditions being sunny days and cooler nights The lower temperatures and shorter days associated with winter cause trees to stop producing chlorophyll the chemical that produces the green color in plants and helps them make energy from sunlight As the chlorophyll degrades two other types of pigments appear from within the leaves That includes carotenoids which produce the yellow and orange colors and anthocyanins which produce the red and purple colors Unfortunately North Carolina has experienced above average temperatures throughout the summer and if the heat persists in the weeks leading up to autumn it could delay the onset of color production according to Bardon The Climate Prediction Center s outlook for September through November shows that the Southeast and other regions across the country will likely continue to experience above average temperatures in the coming months Additionally more than a dozen counties across North Carolina continue to experience abnormally dry conditions due to the above average temperatures and a lack of rainfall which could cause many trees especially shallow rooted species like birches and poplars to lose their leaves early Some trees can tolerate drier conditions and hold onto their leaves until autumn according to Bardon But the leaves that do change typically fall off prematurely and appear in more muted colors than normal The most vibrant foliage appears when there s a warm dry summer followed by early autumn rains he said Anytime there s a disruption in that pattern there can be an impact to the color of the leaves Bardon added that North Carolinians living in areas of drought could still see a vibrant fall this year if moderate rainfall occurs in the coming weeks However if tropical storms continue to occur the heavy sustained rainfall and high winds could knock leaves off of the trees According to the Farmers Almanac fall foliage will peak across the inland regions of North Carolina between October 12 and 28 Meanwhile along the coast foliage is expected to peak between October 19 and November 4 North Carolina is such a big state and the weather can be significantly different from the mountains to the coast Bardon said So no matter what happens there will always be somewhere you can see fall colors Though millions of people visit the Blue Ridge Parkway and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park every autumn for leaf peeping Bardon added that there are just as many viewing opportunities in other parts of North Carolina noting that county and state parks across the Piedmont and Coastal regions provide opportunities for viewing fall foliage that don t require extensive travel 2820 Faucette Dr Campus Box 8001 Raleigh NC 27695 Academic and Student Services 919 515 6191 General Inquiries 919 515 2883 Δ',\n",

       " 'Posted on January 20 2018 Kevin Feenstra Feenstra Guide Service 231 652 3528 It was an extremely cold day today and I left the house thinking that I would go out to the Muskegon River and do some steelhead fishing I covered myself with multiple layers becoming a human onion in a pair of waders Unfortunately my truck battery was dead and by the time I arrived at the river it was 2pm Steelhead bring out anglers in even the harshest of conditions and I was surprised to find anglers from as far away as Idaho fishing out of the boat launch at Pine street despite air temperatures of 11 degrees The Muskegon River is a fantastic fishing resource and the steelhead we have are at the heart of the fishery In the dead of winter steel head will take a fly or lure readily and their numbers increase through the winter months in West Michigan streams Despite a few challenges to the resource it is a prime destination for anyone with the itch to fish during the winter months Photo courtesy of Kevin Feenstra Steelhead begin to course into the Muskegon in late September and through the fall months These fish remain in the river through the winter months with new fish trickling in any time we have snowmelt or a weather event During the fall when water temperatures are warm steelhead will move a long ways to eat a fly lure or bait However during the short cold days of winter their reaction time slows The net result is that you will need to present your offering slow ly in order to give the fish the chance to eat For some anglers this means presenting an egg un der a float or slowly rolling a fly or bait along the bottom My favorite tactic during these cold pe riods is to use flies that look like resident baitfish Because this river system is so fertile it has a huge and very diverse baitfish population Steelhead will prey on any number of these food sources Their versatility is one of the key things to understand about steelhead This feature is what keeps their numbers healthy when baitfish populations rise and fall in Lake Michigan It also makes steelhead appeal to a large audience of anglers Simply put they can subsist on a variety of food sources and as a result will take a wide array of lures and baits Baitfish are vulnerable in the winter months During the summer and fall large weed beds fill the Muskegon These weed beds provide cover for numerous small fish As fall approaches the weeds die off exposing minnows to the predatory fish that lurk beneath Some of these min nows live above the bottom of the river others live in the rocks and gravelly areas One of the things that steelhead really like to eat in the rocky areas of the Muskegon dur ing the cold months is bottom dwelling baitfish such as sculpins and darters During the winter slowly swinging flies that looks like one of these yields steelhead resident brown and rainbow trout and occasionally walleye and northern pike These baitfish are what are considered earth toned in color This means that they look like the bottom of the river In order to imitate them we tie flies that are either olive tan or brown In fact earth toned flies can catch fish at any time of the year in the Muskegon This tactic works in any of the popular fishing waters from Croton Dam all the way to the town of Newaygo It is especially deadly when the water temps are 33 38 de grees As February arrives the water temps change and the days become longer As temps rise the biology of the river explodes making steelhead active There are two things that happen that really make things interesting A type of insect that lives along the bottom of the river starts to move in mass toward the edges of the river These early stoneflies are caught in the current and are an easy target for steelhead which gorge on them At the same time wild king salmon fry begin to emerge from the gravel These too are an easy target for roving steelhead There is a chain reaction in our rivers as this happens small food sources become active fish large and small feed on the small foods and large fish may feed on the smaller fish that are feeding with abandon The net result is that the steelhead are excited and they become more and more willing to move for a fly or bait At the same time the water temps come up making fish more active in general February and March are an exciting time to fish for steelhead As the river temperatures rise not only are the fish more active but there are more of them as spring runs of fish start coursing up the river in addition to the winter steelhead Early spring provides greater numbers of fish which can be very active This is a great combination for the angler Because of their willingness to bite and their increasing numbers you could say that win ter and early spring steelhead are one of the best things we have going at that time of the year These steelhead are a beautiful and abundant game fish that provide recreation and memorable outdoor experience for many residents and tourists to the Newaygo area as well The Muskegon River steelhead fishery does face some challenges Because of the con nections to the Great Lakes invasive species effect various aspects of a steelhead s life cycle While out in Lake Michigan serpent like sea lamprey pose a threat to adult steelhead Gobies a small invasive fish that resembles a sculpin provide food for steelhead and other predators such as smallmouth bass However they squeeze out native baitfish and change the forage base More than a decade ago zebra mussels had a profound effect on the biology of the entire ecosys tem including the Muskegon River Initially the Mussels cleared the water and reduced some of the food sources in the river such as caddis larvae Since that time zebra mussels have be come a part of the ecosystem Their population has stabilized or decreased over time With in vasive species we always worry about the next one on the horizon Asian carp could have dire consequences for our fish populations should they ever reach our rivers and streams Another challenge that the steelhead face in many of our fishing rivers including the Mus kegon is warm summer water temperatures Many of the steelhead that we have in the Mus kegon are planted However wild fish also comprise a sizable percentage of our fish The prob lem that we have is somewhat amazing but sad at the same time After the steelhead spawn in the spring they head back to the lake Soon thereafter baby steelhead start to pop out of the gravel I do not know the exact numbers of fry but it is safe to say there are immense quantities of them during May and early June At first their life cycles are normal they grow quickly up to an inch or two while spring water temperatures are cool Young steelhead must spend a year of their lives in the river so they cannot leave immediately As water temperatures warm it becomes un comfortable for the newborn steelhead As they become disoriented they become less wary and the many predator fish and birds along the river have a feeding frenzy Often times you will see trout that appear to be feeding on insects on the surface of the river They are not eating insects however they are feeding on these disoriented helpless steelhead fry It becomes obvious along the edges of the river One day there are baby steelhead everywhere and the next day it is hard to find even one Keeping water quality high and water temperatures low directly affects the number of steelhead that survive through a given summer If the summer is too hot it is likely that the vast majority of the surviving wild steelhead come from small cold feeder creeks that seep into the river Fortunately the Muskegon is a vibrant resource and has maintained constantly good fish ing for decades in spite of the continuing threats On that cold winter day I finally made it down to the river and found some solitude on the river As it became late afternoon my line finally went tight and a large steelhead broke the surface What fun Steelhead remain at the heart of our fishery and are a resilient and wonderful game fish Though anglers come from everywhere to fish here it is very possible to find solitude on the river on a cold winter s day If you love the out doors and are getting stir crazy look at steelhead fishing as a great all season resource Photo Gallery Courtesy of Kevin Feenstra

Sputnik and subsequent Russian firsts in space convinced many U S policymakers that the country had fallen dangerously behind its Cold War rival Consecutive U S administrations invested in education and scientific research to meet the Soviet challenge These investments propelled the United States to victory in the so called space race and planted the seeds for future innovation and economic competitiveness experts say Yet since the 1990s NASA s share of federal spending has waned The U S private sector has ramped up investment in space and in May 2020 astronauts launched from U S soil for the first time in nearly a decade on a rocket built by the company SpaceX The Soviet Union took the world by surprise in October 1957 with the launch of Sputnik the first artificial satellite In a matter of months President Dwight D Eisenhower and Congress initiated measures to build U S scientific and engineering prowess including the creation of NASA a civilian space exploration agency More on Space Technology and Innovation United States Presidents have largely determined NASA s long term missions In May 1961 a few weeks after the Soviet Union put the first human Yuri Gagarin in space President John F Kennedy committed the United States to a lunar landing He stressed the urgency and value of this mission in a landmark speech at Rice University We choose to go the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills because that challenge is one that we re willing to accept one we are unwilling to postpone and one we intend to win A curation of original analyses data visualizations and commentaries examining the debates and efforts to improve health worldwide Weekly After six successful lunar missions NASA s manned program pulled back to Earth while robotic programs such as Voyager and Viking continued to explore the solar system NASA focused on sending astronauts into low Earth orbit LEO with the 1973 launch of Skylab the first U S space station and the Space Shuttle The Space Shuttle served NASA for thirty years 1981 2011 and helped build the International Space Station ISS an orbiting laboratory that has been continuously occupied by humans since 2000 The agency has also completed a series of unmanned missions to Mars most recently in February 2021 when it landed the Perseverance rover to search for signs that life previously existed on the planet Successive U S administrations have set different space goals The George W Bush administration pushed for a return to the moon and a trip to Mars but President Barack Obama favored an asteroid mission The Obama administration also set a goal of a manned mission to orbit Mars by the mid 2030s which would require the commitment of subsequent presidents President Donald J Trump s administration voiced frustration with delays in the development of Orion a capsule that could one day take astronauts to Mars and urged a manned return to the moon At the same time Trump directed the Department of Defense to create a branch of the military under the aegis of the Air Force that would focus entirely on threats from space an indication of renewed interest in the field In February 2020 a proposed organizational structure for the new space force was delivered to Congress Soon after taking office President Joe Biden s administration announced its support of a space force Space exploration is expensive but it is a relatively minor line item in the U S budget NASA s spending peaked at almost 4 5 percent of the federal budget in 1966 declined to 1 percent by 1975 and has gradually fallen to about half a percent in recent years In comparison defense spending has hovered around 20 percent of the budget in recent years Congress appropriated about 23 billion for NASA in 2021 an increase of roughly 3 percent from the previous year More on Space Technology and Innovation United States Due to the Space Shuttle s retirement in 2011 NASA did not have the means to send astronauts into space by itself for nearly a decade U S astronauts have had to ride Russia s Soyuz capsule to the ISS at a cost of up to 82 million per seat In 2010 former Apollo astronauts Neil Armstrong and Eugene Cernan warned that U S leadership in space exploration could suffer Such criticisms as well as Trump s stated desire to land astronauts on the moon during his tenure spurred the president to boost his budget requests for the agency Historically 85 to 90 percent of NASA s budget went to private contractors largely to design and manufacture rockets and spacecraft while NASA maintained close oversight and operated the equipment But now NASA often privatizes operations as well Advocates of space commercialization believe private firms such as SpaceX and Orbital Sciences both of which won contracts to ferry ISS cargo can provide routine LEO access at a lower cost They say NASA could then focus more on missions that push scientific and exploration frontiers Some go further to suggest that NASA become more like the U S Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or the National Science Foundation by setting objectives such as capturing an asteroid and then giving grants to private firms But critics of privatization argue that development grants and limited competition will yield scant savings Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson believes that while private enterprises can handle routine space flight they are unable to bear the large and unknown risks of advancing the space frontier In May 2020 SpaceX became the first private company to successfully ferry two NASA astronauts to the ISS using its Falcon 9 rocket and attached Crew Dragon capsule President Trump said the launch makes clear the commercial space industry is the future The astronauts safely returned to Earth in August and in November NASA certified SpaceX to begin routine missions The first of these was carried out that same month sending four astronauts three American and one Japanese to the ISS Additionally SpaceX has announced that it plans to send three space tourists to the ISS in late 2021 NASA is also collaborating with the private sector for its Artemis program which aims to put astronauts including the first woman on the moon by 2024 In April 2020 NASA announced that the human landers for the program would be developed by SpaceX Blue Origin owned by Jeff Bezos founder and chief executive of Amazon and the Alabama based company Dynetics The Biden administration has pledged its continued support for Artemis Some entrepreneurs see a commercial future in space beyond NASA contracts and satellite launches U S based Space Adventures offers customers the opportunity to orbit Earth and experience the views and weightlessness of space travel Other firms have pursued asteroid mining which supporters believe could supply a new abundance of precious metals and rare earth elements Bezos has said he plans to build a road to space so that humans will one day be able to sustain colonies beyond Earth Fellow billionaire Richard Branson founded the spaceflight firm Virgin Galactic hoping to become the industry leader in a future space tourism sector The space race of the 1960s and 1970s captured the American public s imagination like few other human endeavors A 2009 study in the journal Nature found that the Apollo program had inspired half of scientists surveyed and almost 90 percent believed that manned space exploration inspired younger generations to study science Some evidence supports this According to the National Science Foundation the percentage of graduates holding bachelor s degrees in science and engineering fields peaked in the late 1960s around the time of the moon landing but then declined slowly for several decades before recent administrations began to reemphasize PDF the importance of funding science technology engineering and mathematics STEM education Space exploration can also foster innovation pushing the limits of technology and requiring the collaboration of some of the brightest people across multiple disciplines As Jim Bell president of the Planetary Society a nonprofit group dedicated to space exploration advocacy and education told CFR When you re embarking on an enterprise that is the hardest thing to do it often attracts the best people who are intrigued by very difficult problems and want to have a sense in purpose in applying their knowledge to something big Since 1976 technologies originally developed for space exploration have led to more than two thousand spinoffs when they were transferred to the private sector Some are obvious such as communications satellites but other transfers are less well known Many medical advances are derived from space technologies such as refinements in artificial hearts improved mammograms and laser eye surgery Space exploration drove the development of new materials and industrial techniques including thermoelectric coolers for microchips high temperature lubricants and a means for mass producing carbon nanotubes a material with significant engineering potential Household products such as memory foam mattresses Bluetooth headphones programmable ovens vacuums and ski apparel all trace their origins to NASA Only the United States has sent people beyond low Earth orbit but experts say U S preeminence in space could be challenged China became the third nation to independently launch a human into orbit in 2003 and its capabilities have since grown The People s Liberation Army is seen as a driver of the Chinese space program the ambitions of which include sending people to the moon and building a space station Meanwhile India launched its first unmanned mission to Mars in late 2013 and its probe entered Mars s orbit in September 2014 The Indian Space Research Organisation has since reached an agreement with NASA on subsequent explorations of Mars China and the United Arab Emirates successfully sent spacecraft to orbit Mars in February 2021 the same month that NASA landed its rover there the Chinese mission includes its own robotic explorer Another international mission the landing of a European Space Agency probe on a comet attracted widespread interest in November 2014 Though the probe was unable to anchor properly due to a landing mishap it was still able to send a large amount of valuable data to scientists SpaceIL an Israeli organization launched a moon lander in early 2019 that ultimately crashed into the moon Nevertheless the attempt marked the first privately funded moon landing and made Israel the fourth country to attempt a soft moon landing India became the fifth such country in September 2019 but it too failed when its lander appeared to crash into the moon Space can also inspire international cooperation In 1963 during what would be his final speech before the United Nations President Kennedy asked Why should the United States and the Soviet Union in preparing for such expeditions become involved in immense duplications of research construction and expenditure Kennedy s vision eventually materialized with the 1975 Apollo Soyuz Test Project in which U S and Russian spacecraft docked for the first time Today the United States is the ISS s managing partner leading fourteen nations in perhaps humanity s most expensive project The space agencies of Europe Russia and Japan were also important partners on robotic missions such as the Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity The ISS will likely deorbit in the 2020s but many say deeper space missions will need to be international ventures In May 2020 NASA announced the framework for the Artemis Accords a series of bilateral agreements with other space agencies that want to participate in the Artemis program CFR s David P Fidler praised the accords writing that they embrace rules and principles developed through multilateralism rather than a scofflaw version of American unilateralism Space policy experts agree that NASA faces considerable challenges including new budget pressures aging infrastructure the rise of competing spacefaring nations and the lack of a strong national vision for human spaceflight An independent assessment by the National Research Council in 2012 noted that a crewed mission to Mars has never received sufficient funding to advance beyond the rhetoric stage The Trump administration s push to create a space force within the military could be a sign that an era of cooperation in space is ending In response to Trump s order Daryl G Kimball of the Arms Control Association said At worst it is the first step in an accelerated competition between the U S China and Russia in the space realm that is going to be more difficult to avert without direct talks about responsible rules of the road CFR s Stewart M Patrick agrees that the stage could be set for a Cold War style space race that overwhelms any multilateral cooperation At the same time policymakers face a growing number of issues around NASA s present day purpose and methods These include how the agency should balance various goals such as driving scientific discovery enhancing national security and developing innovations with commercial benefits how large a role the private sector should play and to what extent NASA can be a vehicle for international cooperation and diplomacy Despite these questions many experts have advocated sustaining U S leadership in space I m convinced that in this century the nations that lead in the world are going to be those that create new knowledge And one of the places where you have a huge opportunity to create new knowledge will be exploration of the universe exploration of the solar system and the building of technology that allows you to do that said former congressman and aerospace expert Robert Walker at a CFR meeting on

       " 'The steelhead is a rainbow trout that migrates from the river to the sea and back again with much size and power to show for it Rainbow trout and steelhead are the same species but completely different animals Considered one of if not the most noble of sportfish the steelhead is famous for its beautiful shape and color its unrelenting aerobatic fight when hooked and the extreme weather and water environments it often inhabits These factors combine to make the pursuit of steelhead a serious challenge and an addiction unto itself Their fanatics like the fish themselves are wanderers searchers hunters They are some of flyfishing s most serious devotees and will go to any length through any weather at any cost just for a chance The tug is the drug it doesn t come often and you don t get it by staying home A steelhead is a rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss which is born in a river and then after a juvenile period migrates to the sea like a salmon Eventually after usually 2 or 3 years they return to their natal streams to spawn While most steelhead will die after spawning some will return to the sea and survive to spawn again What triggers a salt water migration in some trout but not in others remains a thing of a mystery but whatever the reason their oceanic journeys are legendary For instance a tagged steelhead of Columbia River Oregon origin was once recaptured off the coast of Japan and unlike salmon which maraud the high seas in schools steelhead swim solo These unique characteristics add to the intense mystique ascribed to them but ultimately it s the size and power of a steelhead gained in the ocean that is the draw to flyfishers This transformation from rainbow trout to steelhead from meager river origin to the supercharged energy of the sea is like that of Superman before and after stepping into the phone booth Historically steelhead were found in most river systems of the North Pacific Rim from Kamchatka Russia to Baja Mexico Today habitat loss in their southern range makes their northern range a very important focus British Columbia s Skeena River watershed the Alaska Peninsula and Kodiak Island and the west coast

miraheze org Discord https discord gg t6BtZqC Patreon https www patreon com earendel Space Exploration is an overhaul mod about unique experiences and challenges After you launch a rocket you start discovering new planets moons asteroid belts and other stars You build an expansive space station as your main research facility explore new planets and moons outpost for special resources and gradually progress into the darkness of deep space as you expand your interstellar empire There s a lot in the mod already but it is still in heavy development and things are changing rapidly For this reason the mod is considered to be in Experimental Status see below There may be occasional bugs but they get resolved quickly You want to use lots of mods at the same time conflicting mods or other overhaul mods You don t care about game balance and don t want a mod to balance things You don t want to start a new game and you don t like long games Wiring a circuit condition to an inserter is too much for you You want to explore new worlds and new civilizations You want a refined balanced cohesive experience from a minimal mod list You want some genuinely new and unique game mechanics and challenges You want gradual progression and new mechanics introduced over a 100 hour game You like uncovering secrets and puzzles The mod focuses on experience and challenge over modular content this means that Space Exploration does not work well with many other mods One of the main themes is interplanetary logistics and that is driven by different resource and energy balances in different locations It is easy for other mods to disrupt this balance especially if the mod has ways to generate power that don t rely on solar or scarce resources If you are starting your first Space Exploration game you should stick to only the recommended mods quality of life mods you can t do without otherwise you won t have the background knowledge to see what gameplay is broken by other mods The current mod compatibility situation will improve in the future especially in regard to other overhaul mods See Experimental Status below A space Exploration game is long Early game is characterised with basic sciences on your homeworld and launching a satellite rocket into space Mid game has you building a research space station exploring new planets looking for strategic resources and getting started on the 4 specialist science packs You have 4 types of specialist science to choose from your decision can be based solely on the techs you want but may also be influenced by the strategic resources you have discovered so far Late game leads you to deep space expanding an interstellar empire and working on the complexities of deep space science Finally you gain the ability to escape the stellar cluster and win the game Over 600 new places to visit planets moons stars asteroids fields and more Each location has its own resource bias and challenges The planet you start on Nauvis is huge but ultimately limited You are unlikely to run out of the resources it has but your homeworld won t have all the resource types you need to complete the game Other planets and moons have different sizes resources and climates Tight integration with the Alien Biomes mod means each planet and moon has some visual character Different planets have different challenges some may be waterless some have low solar some may be windy bad for robots and some may have excessively hostile natives There will be more environmental challenges added in the future Places in your solar system can be discovered by launching more navigation satellites Later you can use telescopes to look for places outside of your solar system via zone discovery research Launching a navigation satellite unlocks the Navigation Satellite Uplink This allows you to look around from the satellite s point of view detached from your character You can look at any planet you have discovered and scout the surface You can even make data changes while in this mode changing combinator requester or inserter settings You can also use blueprint library blueprints the deconstruction planner copy and paste etc Press N to start end an uplink Space exploration adds a number of new resources Water ice and methane ice can be found in space and make life up there a little easier Ice is a convenient way to transport water and methane can be converted to other hydrocarbons giving you a 2nd route to oil products Cryonite has applications in cooling supercomputing and some refinement of other materials Vulcanite has a number of uses as a smelting additive fuel and is needed for rocket science Beryllium is used for lightweight construction and logistics spaceships and astronomic science Holmium is used for energy systems shields and energy science Iridium is used for heavy industry and military purposes and material science Vitamelange is an organic substance used in bio science Naquium is a strange material with no chemical properties only found in interstellar asteroid fields It is used for deep space science and end game structures Arcospheres are unlike other resources They are not mined but gained from launching collection probes from interstellar asteroid fields The numbers found diminishes with repeated launches from the same site so it is difficult to gather large numbers of them The ones you do get however are never lost They are needed in certain recipes and are always returned though not in their original state One of the big advantages to claiming a new planet is the use of a core miner A core miner gives you access to unlimited resources but you can only use one at full efficiency on a planet Multiple core miners on the same planet or moon have diminishing returns Each planet or moon has its own core fragment type that yields different resources Homeworlds always return a mixed fragment type with some basic resources Core fragments from other planets and moons will return a fragment type that matches their primary resource Space exploration science packs need to be made and used in space so you are required to build your own space based research station The rocket science pack acts as an introduction to space platform construction and that basic infrastructure needed for later science packs Most of scientific progress in Space Exploration is split between 4 parallel specialist science packs Each one needs specialised equipment and specific resources These new sciences are data driven and more difficult to set up Material science is focussed on testing existing and new experimental materials It unlocks some improved industrial and military systems Astronomic science is focussed on observation data from telescopes and astrophysics It unlocks improvements to cargo rockets and spaceships and other space logistic improvements Energy science is focussed on particle physics and energy fields It unlocks improved power systems energy shields and energy weapons Biological science is focussed on genetic engineering and testing specimens It unlocks character upgrades bio weapons and productivity boosts You can choose how you want to progress through these sciences A basic initial setup is not going to be resource efficient or fast but you can develop the sciences further to unlock faster more resource efficient recipes Finally you move on to deep space science which unlocks the most advanced end game technology but has the most difficult production challenges Build your own space stations using space platform Space stations are usually research stations mining stations solar collectors waypoint stations or orbital bombardment platforms Space platform is made from platform tiles like landfill Most structures don t work in space so you need specialised versions To survive in space you need a space suit The space suit you build is a thruster suit with magnetic boots so you can walk on space platform While not on space platform you float around in space with momentum Your thruster has a built in jetpack so you can fly around in style The space suit also has built in lifesport equipment Lifesupport is made possible by consumable lifesupport canisters and the lifesupport equipment improves the efficiency of these canisters It is needed in space and planets with hazardous atmospheres such as plague worlds Cargo rockets can launch a huge cargo inventory from anywhere to anywhere If you enter the cargo rocket silo before launch then you can go along for the ride This can take you into orbit other planets and moons even to other solar systems If a rocket is sent to a landing pad you get rocket parts back and reusability can be improved with technology Cargo rocket launches can be automated in a number of ways to help you manage your interplanetary logistic system If the rocket is not sent to a landing pad it will disassemble and deploy the cargo pods If a cargo pod contains a Spidertron the Spidertron will be deployed Build your own spaceship block by block The core component is the spaceship console Make sure it is on spaceship floor and surrounded by spaceship walls or doors It needs containment from outside space so make sure there are no gaps Attach a rocket engine launch booster some accumulators and lasers and you re good to go Fly from anywhere to anywhere Upgrades let you build bigger ships with better equipment You can even have trains on your spaceship for fast loading and unloading of cargo Build a large spaceship and power a space warping device on it If you can get to the required speed in interstellar space and hold it for 60 seconds you win the game A delivery cannon can fire a disposable capsule filled with a stack of basic resources to most places within the same solar system The package must be caught safely in a delivery cannon chest otherwise the capsule hits the ground with a lot of force and will spill any surviving contents The weapons delivery cannon is a larger variant of the delivery cannon designed for interplanetary bombardment It fires munitions such as the atomic bomb iridium piledriver or plague bomb Energy beaming allows you to send energy from an area of energy abundance to where it is needed Close solar orbit is the typical place to build an energy beam emitter The strength of the beam at the source can be increased with energy injectors The strength of the beam at the destination is reduced by distance It can reach interstellar targets but is less efficient The energy can be used to generate heat in an energy beam receiver or can be used in Glaive mode to cut lines through your enemies In Glaive mode the beam can choose targets autonomously The speed damage and area of the beam is determined by the beam s strength when it arrives at the destination therefore is reduced by distance The stars in the area are unstable and frequently release Coronal Mass Ejections CMEs A CME is caused by a solar flare but unlike a normal solar flare it ejects a substantial amount for the star s corona In Space Exploration this takes the form of beams that wander around the surface of a planet for a couple of minutes a bit like tornados They start fires and damage structures but only happen once every 1 2 days of real time You always get a lot of early warning for a CME and can see a timer for the next one in Informatron Can be disabled with a mod setting The Umbrella protects against energy beams When protecting against a CME the energy cost of the Umbrella for the event is given by the CME warning system When protecting against a hostile player s Glaive energy beam in PvP the energy cost is 1 10th the strength of the hostile beam as it arrives Weapon beams are already reduced in strength by distance so the Umbrella is very power efficient against them Universe Explorer lets you sort filter search for and prioritise zones You can see most of the various zone attributes like solar multiplier radius climates tags threat and resources You can also set a force specific priority for different zones set your satellite to automatically scan a surface and delete unused surfaces to reduce your file size Space Exploration adds a lot of pages to Informatron so you can read about certain mechanics in game however it goes far beyond adding static encyclopedia style content On the Cargo Rockets page it shows you how many cargo rockets you launched On the Zone Discovery page there is an interactive interface that lets you choose the resource you are searching for The Exploration Journal page gets additional entries as you progress through the game and experience new things There are even some hidden pages that you can unlock by investigating secret exploration content Basic beacons now have 8 module slots and the normal 9x9 area Wide area beacons have 15 module slots and cover a 32x32 area Wide area beacon 2s have 20 module slots and cover a 32x32 area Each structure can only be affected by 1 beacon If 2 beacons affect the same structure it overloads and stops working These changes allow for more interesting designs where you are building machines around beacons instead of beacons around machines In Space Exploration there are 9 tiers of modules Each module costs 3 of the tier before it so tier 9 modules are prohibitively expensive for mass production This encourages more strategic use of powerful modules where they make the most difference For example you might use tier 6 productivity modules to process certain resources but use tier 9 modules in your science labs Not all modules need to be gained through manufacture you may also be able to gain some powerful modules through exploration The only space structures that can use productivity modules are labs and miners for everything else productivity is disabled This makes it much more efficient to go general resource processing refinement and component manufacture on planets where you can make use of productivity however manufacturing in space can be convenient if you already have all the materials there The compromise of resource efficiency vs convenience increases as you progress deeper into the game because rocket costs decrease with more technology and productivity boosts increase with better modules The recycling facility lets you break down certain items into scrap and turns scrap into some basic resources It can also turn barrels back into steel The Space Exploration solar panels are 4x4 powerful but expensive but most importantly you can walk on them The Condenser turbine is like a normal steam turbine but takes in steam and outputs water Compared to the steam turbine a condenser turbine is 75 energy efficient but recovers 99 of the water The big heat exchanger and big turbine generator are much larger but more powerful options They make and use 5000 degree steam The big turbine recovers most of the steam as water and outputs a small amount of unused 500 degree steam In late game you gain the ability to mass produce antimatter It costs a lot of energy to make but is a fantastic form of energy storage The energy can be retrieved from an antimatter reactor where it is needed Antimatter engines are a big upgrade for spaceships Pylons come in 4 versions and can be fast replaced to more easily build your power grid Normal pylons act like big power pole Pylons substations act like a huge range substation Construction pylons are like normal pylons but also extend your construction grid so are great for rail maintenance and connecting logistic grids Radar construction pylons provide radar vision and a huge construction area so are well suited to large new construction projects The Addon power pole can be attached to existing structures and does not take up its own tile The power supply area is only 1x1 but that is big enough to power the structure it is attached to This enables builds that wouldn t be possible otherwise but can also be used with power switches for fine control over which entities get powered The supercharger is designed to solve robot charging congestion issues It has 64 charging slots and can charge most robots in 1 60th of a second The consequence is an erratic load on your power grid Settings are configurable in mod options To get fluids long distances you can use long pipes A long pipe is a single in game entity so it moves the fluid further faster and helps save UPS There are also long heat pipes that let you get heat further with less heat loss The shield projector creates a section of a bubble shield energy wall in front of it 8 shields in a formation can make the complete circle If the energy shield takes damage the projector draws more power to repair that damage To a certain extent the wall s ability to take damage is only limited by your power supply Sudden extreme damage can overwhelm the shield causing it to collapse but it will reappear once the projector has absorbed more electricity Note If you have the Combat Mechanics Overhaul mod installed the energy walls can block enemy projectiles They fall from the sky and usually land somewhere remote adding extra resources Sometimes they hit a structure which is unfortunate but happens Meteor rate is mod option You can defend against meteors with meteor defences Meteor point defence can protect a small area and is best used as a 2nd line of defence for high priority locations Meteor defence installation can protect the whole surface but take more power In PvP both types of meteor defence types also protect against Delivery cannon and Weapons delivery cannon projectiles The Tesla gun shoots chain lightning to hit up to 30 semi random targets per shot and it s rapid fire Only damages enemies trees and rocks This is the most fun weapon Bloatburst ammo can cause enemies to explode and deal damage around them based on their max hp The percentage damage means it scales very well into late game and becomes more powerful against larger groups The pheromone dart can confuse an enemy unit making it indifferent to you and hostile to its own kind The Railgun does a very long range piercing shot like a sniper rifle firing a supersonic tank shell The Cryogun can make walls of ice and freeze enemies solid Frozen enemies can t move or attack The weapon lacks the damage of some of the other options but the ability to block enemies and freeze worms makes it extremely powerful when paired with personal lasers Bio technology allows you to deploy lab grown biters from capsules the same way you use combat robots The plague rocket is a strategic level weapon One shot can wipe out all life from a planet If your UPS drops too low after use you can reduce the max lifetime of the plague simulation in mod options Natural health regeneration is very slow but Space Exploration adds multiple tiers of medpacks The early medpacks are cheap but relatively ineffective later ones are more expensive but much more effective and can heal more than the starting character s health pool Note Bio tech upgrades can increase your health pool substantially It s not game over when you die you can respawn on Nauvis a random launchpad or a random spaceship You can use the space capsule to get out of most situations but if you land on a tiny island on a planet and you have no landfill you might be really stuck If you find yourself with no way out there is a respawn button It s the red one with a skull on it You can find it in shortcut buttons list on the right of your toolbar You can also use it by pressing the Home button Space Exploration has a lot of exploration and investigation focussed content A lot of it is secret so you ll need to find it yourself If you ve ever wanted the chance at your own personal Indiana Jones Daniel Jackson investigation trail with no rails or signposting this is your chance The current status of PvP is still in an early testing phase There have been a few games running for months testing the mechanics If you want to set up your own PvP game you will need an admin that is comfortable running commands The setup command is in Space Exploration s remote interface lua file Setup Each force has its own homeworld and home system The 2nd homeworld matches the settings of Nauvis but is around a different star All of the guaranteed properties of the normal starting star system are replicated to the star for the 2nd player force Making the new home system alters the univer s resource distribution system so this should only be done right at the start of a new game Notes on PvP gameplay Team s don t start with enemy homeworlds discovered you need to discover enemy surfaces using the normal discovery mechanics Weapons delivery cannon projectiles are shot down by meteor defences so it is difficult to overwhelm their baseline defences The in system range of Weapons delivery cannons means that you probably need to make an orbital bombardment platform to target an enemy homeworld but this platform is likely to be very vulnerable to counter attack Energy beam Glaives have interstellar range but are easily defended against by an Umbrella so are mainly useful in disrupting smaller outposts Spaceships drops are vulnerable to defending artillery so can be a 1 way trip Grappling Gun To catch yourself if you fall off your space station https mods factorio com mod

Exploration is still changing rapidly and I am putting all my time into progressing the development of the key features at the expense of mod compatibility It is not advisable to play with mods other than the required and recommended mods While in experimental status If a mod causes problems such as corrupted game save state crashes invalid tech trees or core gameplay it will quickly be marked as incompatible to protect new players This means if you use a lot of mods it is more likely one may be marked as incompatible later due to an issue you had not yet discovered You are of course free to edit your info json file to try incompatible mods but you do so at your own risk if your game state becomes unplayable because of it I won t be able to help you While in experimental status Most other overhaul mods are marked as incompatible if the tech tree is significantly broken however the long term intention is to get the mods working together to the satisfaction of both developers Krastorio 2 is an example of this work already substantially underway There is some additional information relating to mod compatibility on the Space Exploration wiki If you would like to assist with mod compatibility please reach out on discord but please also be aware that it is not a high priority until later in Space Exploration s development Coming soon Space Elevator Space capsule hop system

       " 'With the COVID 19 pandemic affecting every aspect of everyday life it s easy to forget about what else is going on in the world and that includes significant historical moments and fun holidays One of them is May 1 Space Day which is Friday 24 7 Tempo has compiled a list of the coolest and most unforgettable moments in space exploration after reviewing material from NASA news articles from decades ago and information from the National Archives and Records Administration If Christopher Columbus Ferdinand Magellan Amerigo Vespucci and Vasco Da Gama helped Western civilization in the Age of Discovery reach new worlds in the Space Age Yuri Gagarin John Glenn Valentina Tereshkova and Neil Armstrong took humanity to Earth s orbit and beyond Those space pioneers launched our world into a realm that had been pondered by astronomers philosophers religious figures science fiction writers and poets The Space Age paralleled the Cold War and when the Soviet Union succeeded in launching Sputnik into space in 1957 it was seen as much a threat to U S national security as a scientific triumph Sputnik s success was the starting gun of the space race that put the prestige of nations on the line The competition for supremacy in space made national heroes of Gagarin Glenn Tereshkova and Armstrong among many other astronauts and cosmonauts in the 20th century They would gain fame as astronauts on the Mercury and Apollo missions during the 1960s here are 30 special skills astronauts need to master to do their job Google s MyMaps Feature gets huge boost during crisis for mapping test sites to child care for responders Apple s new iPhone SE Smartphone costs just 399 Here s what you need to know 1 Sputnik I Date Oct 4 1957 The Soviet Union began the space race by launching humankind s first artificial satellite The 23 inch diameter sphere transmitted signals to Earth for 22 days and continued in orbit until burning up on Jan 4 1958 The launch of Sputnik shook up the United States which feared a technology gap between itself and the Soviet Union and began to revamp the nation s science and engineering education A year later NASA was created 2 First creature in space Date Nov 3 1957 A stray husky spitz mix named Laika was the first living creature to orbit the Earth She was also the first fatal casualty in the Space Age According to documents at the National Air and Space Museum Laika reached orbit alive aboard Sputnik 2 and orbited the Earth in 103 minutes But the temperature inside the capsule soared above 90 degrees after the fourth orbit following the loss of the heat shield and Laika died soon afterward The capsule continued to orbit for five months 3 US launches first satellite Date Jan 31 1958 The United States joined the space race when Explorer 1 was launched into orbit on Jan 31 1958 The satellite lifted off from Cape Canaveral in Florida under the direction of legendary German born scientist Wernher Von Braun Explorer 1 which was 80 inches long and 6 25 inches in diameter revolved around Earth in a looping orbit that took it as close as 220 miles of Earth and as far away as 1 563 miles Explorer orbited the Earth more than 58 000 times before burning up on March 31 1970 4 First creatures return from space Date May 28 1959 Less than two years after Laika perished while orbiting the Earth two monkeys Able and Baker became the first living beings to return to our planet alive Able a female rhesus monkey and Baker a female squirrel monkey were sent into space by the United States aboard a Jupiter missile The flight lasted about 15 minutes and the spacecraft s speed topped 10 000 miles an hour The monkeys suffered no ill effects from the flight that included a period of weightlessness The success of the mission encouraged scientists to believe manned space travel was possible Able died during a medical procedure shortly after the flight but Baker became a celebrity and received as many as 150 letters a day from schoolchildren 5 Yuri Gagarin Date April 12 1961 Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to fly into space and return to Earth safely beating the United States by several weeks Gagarin circled the planet in 108 minutes aboard the Vostok 1 spacecraft that traveled at 17 000 miles an hour The launch of Sputnik and the triumph of putting a man into space were twin shocks to American pride and ratcheted up the competition in the space race The new space race Many countries and companies seek resources on the moon and Mars Space tech Inventions we use every day that were actually created for space exploration 6 First US man in space Date May 1 1961 The United States had hoped to be the first nation to put a man into space but the Soviet Union won that race with Gagarin accomplishing that feat Several weeks later Alan Shepard flew the Freedom 7 spacecraft on a suborbital 15 minute flight that reached a peak altitude of 116 miles and a top speed of 5 180 miles an hour Unlike Gagarin whose capsule was automatically controlled Shepard was able to take control of his spacecraft for short periods 7 Kennedy s speech on space exploration Date May 25 1961 Several weeks after Alan Shepard became the first American in space President John F Kennedy gave a speech before both houses of Congress committing the nation to space exploration Kennedy s clarion call for an ambitious space program included landing Americans on the moon and returning them safely to Earth by the end of the decade as well as other space projects 8 Glenn orbits Earth Date Feb 20 1962 Less than a year after Gagarin became the first man to orbit the Earth John Glenn became the first American to do so completing three orbits around the planet aboard the Friendship 7 capsule Glenn was already a military hero by the time he was chosen to be an astronaut for Project Mercury After he completed his mission he went on to a successful political career as senator from Ohio He made history again at the age of 77 in 1998 by becoming the oldest person to fly into space when he flew on the space shuttle 9 First woman in space Date June 16 1963 Cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova is not a household name in the United States but she is revered in Russia because she was the first woman to fly in space 20 years before Sally Ride became the first American woman to do so Tereshkova orbited Earth 48 times in her space capsule the Vostok 6 That was her only trip into space She received the highest honors from the Soviet Union and was bestowed the United Nations Gold Medal of Peace Tereshkova toured the world and became a staunch advocate for Soviet science 10 First space walk Date March 25 1965 Russian cosmonaut Alexei Leonov became the first person to walk in space after leaving the Voskhod spacecraft that carried two passengers Leonov walked in space for about 10 minutes His suit expanded minutes after he stepped into space owing to the lack of pressure and he was unable to fit through the hatch when he tried return to the spacecraft Leonov had to release a valve to partially depressurize his suit to allow him to get back into the spaceship Three months later Ed White would become the first American to walk in space 11 First pictures of Mars Date June 14 1965 The spacecraft Mariner 4 was the first to fly to Mars and the first to transmit pictures of Mars Mariner 4 spent all of 25 minutes taking 21 photographs of the red planet from distances ranging between 6 200 miles and 10 500 miles above the planet Those first blurry images of Mars s craters and barren landscape suggested to some scientists that the planet was similar to our moon and dispelled hope that it had ever held life 12 Soviets land spacecraft on moon Venus Date Feb 3 1966 1966 would prove to be a significant year for the Soviet space program In February of that year the USSR would land an unmanned spacecraft called Luna on the moon that sent back transmissions to Earth Less than a month later on March 1 the Soviet Union would succeed in landing a spacecraft on Venus The Venera 3 impacted Venus the first spacecraft to land on another planet but the communications systems failed before any data could be retrieved 13 US lands spacecraft on moon Date June 2 1966 The United States still playing catch up in the space race landed its first spacecraft the unmanned Surveyor 1 on the moon in June The mission was considered a success and the technology needed to achieve landing and operations on the lunar surface succeeded Surveyor 1 performed engineering functions and took photos It sent televised images of the spacecraft s footpad and the lunar surface 14 Soviet spacecraft first to orbit moon Date Sept 15 1968 The Russian spacecraft Zond 5 became the first spacecraft to orbit the moon and return to Earth Aboard the Zond 5 were turtles mealworms seeds bacteria and other living things After the spacecraft landed in the Indian Ocean all of the biological passengers were safely recovered The flight was seen as a precursor to manned lunar landing 15 Apollo 8 Date Dec 21 28 1968 Apollo 8 was among the most famous of America s space missions the first manned spacecraft to leave Earth s gravity and reach the moon The mission conducted a number of tests that were crucial to the lunar landing the following year The crew photographed the lunar surface both the far side and nearside as well as Earth The mission Earthrise photo would become among the most famous of the 20th century The astronauts had six live television transmissions including the Christmas Eve broadcast in which they read from the book of Genesis at the time the most watched TV broadcast ever 16 Men walk on moon Date July 20 1969 American astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to set foot on a celestial entity other than Earth on July 20 1969 fulfilling President John F Kennedy s hope of landing humans on the moon before the end of the decade Armstrong s quote as he stepped on the lunar surface That s one small step for man one giant leap for mankind has become immortal It was one of America s proudest moments witnessed by hundreds of millions of people on television around the world Armstrong and Aldrin spent two and a half hours on the surface collecting rocks and soil samples and among other tasks measuring by laser the exact

September 1977 Voyagers 1 and 2 were launched two weeks apart by NASA in 1977 NASA wanted to take advantage of a unique alignment of planets that happens once every 176 years Such an alignment could slingshot each spacecraft from one planet to the next aided by a planet s gravity Voyager 1 would become the first spacecraft to fly by Jupiter and Saturn It transmitted its first pictures of Jupiter back to Earth in April 1978 when it was 165 million miles away Voyager 1 was the first to journey into interstellar space in 2012 Voyager 2 flew past Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune Since their launch the spacecraft have been traveling along different flight paths and at different speeds 24 Space shuttle takes off Date April 12 1981 NASA s shuttle Columbia became the first winged spaceship

program for more than two years 25 First US woman into space Date June 18 1983 Sally Ride became first American woman in space about 20 years after Soviet cosmonaut Tereshkova became the first woman in space Ride who held a doctorate in physics was selected as one of NASA s first six female astronauts She entered space aboard the space shuttle Challenger Ride would make two shuttle flights Among the tasks she performed in flight were operating the shuttle s robotic arm 26 Voyager 2 transmits images from Uranus Date Jan 24 1986 Voyager 2 launched into orbit with Voyager 1 in 1977 began transmitting images from Uranus in 1986 The massive planet showed some evidence of boiling oceanic water Voyager 2 also found 10 new moons and two new rings around Uranus Voyager 2 would become the only spacecraft to study all four of the solar system s outer planets at close range 27 Voyager 2 transmits images from Neptune Date Aug 1 1989 Voyager 2 was built to examine the farthest reaches of the solar system and this included the planet Neptune The spacecraft is the only human made object to have flown to that planet During its journey Voyager 2 found five moons and four rings around Neptune It was discovered that Neptune s largest moon Triton was the coldest known planetary body in the solar system The planet also was more active than previously believed with winds exceeding 680 miles per hour Hydrogen was the most common element in the atmosphere 28 Hubble space telescope Date April 25 1990 The Hubble space telescope was the first such device placed in space to orbit the Earth a great leap forward toward our understanding of the cosmos and revolutionized astronomy The telescope was developed by NASA along with the European Space Agency The device named after Edwin Powell Hubble was placed into orbit by members of the space shuttle Discovery The telescope is located high above clouds and beyond light pollution and is able to capture high resolution images of space The device enables NASA to better observe space shuttles and space walks 29 Mapping Venus Date Aug 10 1990 NASA s Magellan spacecraft began mapping the surface of Venus using radar equipment The objective of the mission was to study land formations plate tectonics and erosion The spacecraft was also tasked with modeling the interior of Venus Magellan s mission revealed that Venus showed no evidence of Earth like plate tectonics and that 85 of the planet s surface were of volcanic lava flow with the remainder mountain formations 30 Discovery of extrasolar planets Date Oct 6 1995 The scientific community made an important announcement on Oct 6 1995 Swiss astronomers Didier Queloz and Michel Mayor found the first so called exoplanet that was orbiting a star like our sun The exoplanet so named because it is outside our solar system was named 51 Pegasi b also called Dimidium The planet s surface was hot and gaseous and it is about half the size of Jupiter Since then astronomers have found several thousand extrasolar planets 31 Galileo probe Date Dec 7 1995 NASA s Galileo spacecraft was launched from the space shuttle Atlantis in 1989 and arrived at Jupiter six years later The spacecraft explored Jupiter and its moons for almost four years The mission found indications of melted saltwater ocean under an ice layer on Jupiter s moon Europa It also found evidence of liquid saltwater on two other moons Galileo s mission ended on Sept 21 2003 when it descended into Jupiter s atmosphere 32 Pathfinder arrives on Mars transmits data Date July 4 1997 The Mars Pathfinder which arrived on Mars on America s birthday in 1997 was significant in that the mission included the first successful rover on Mars The rover was called Sojourner named after Sojourner Truth An interesting aspect of the mission was NASA s use of a different landing technique for the lander Instead of using rockets to touch down on the surface NASA employed airbags The rover examined rounded pebbles and cobbles at the landing site and the shape of rocks suggested these so called conglomerates were formed as the result of running water from a past when the weather was warmer Pathfinder also observed water ice clouds in the lower atmosphere in early morning 33 International Space Station Date Nov 20 1998 The International Space Station launched in 1998 is a multinational habitable satellite located in the Earth s lower orbit It is the biggest artificial body in space and at times can be seen with the naked eye The ISS has played an important role in American and Russian space missions since its launch Fifteen nations manage and use the ISS with NASA United States Roscosmos Russia and the European Space Agency as the major partners who contribute the most funding The ISS has witnessed many milestones among them the biggest gathering in space 13 people and the longest spacewalk at 8 hours and 56 minutes during a construction mission in 2001 involving astronauts Jim Voss and Susan Helms Jeanne Crews a female engineer at NASA invented a multi layered shield that is as light but stronger than aluminum and it is still in use on the ISS 34 Landing on an asteroid Date Feb 1 2001 The NEAR Shoemaker was the first spacecraft specifically designed to study an asteroid In this case the asteroid was Eros the closest asteroid to Earth As NEAR descended onto Eros it sent back dozens of high resolution pictures Even though NEAR was not designed to land on an asteroid NASA decided to do so It touched down and sent back data until its final signal on Feb 28 2001 35 First space tourist Date April 28 2001 Dennis Tito a millionaire businessman from California became the first paying passenger to travel into outer space opening up the commercialization possibilities of space flight Tito dropped a cool 20 million for the privilege He took off off from Kazakhstan for an eight day trip aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft and flew to the International Space Station 36 Cassini spacecraft sends back images of Saturn s rings Date July 1 2004 The Cassini mission a collaborative effort of NASA the ESA and the Italian Space Agency launched on October 1997 and arrived at Saturn about seven years later Since the spacecraft reached Saturn Cassini has taken more than 450 000 images of the planet its famous rings and its moons The spacecraft operated for 13 years before plunging into Saturn s atmosphere on Sept 15 2017 37 Mars rover landing Date Aug 6 2012 The rover Curiosity is still operating on Mars It has sent detailed photographs of the Martian landscape and scientists believe that the red planet likely had an environment that could have supported life a long time ago According to NASA the mission has four goals Determine whether life ever existed on Mars analyze the Martian climate study the geology of the planet and prepare for human exploration 38 Musk rocket returns to Earth Date April 8 2016 When he is not pioneering electric car technology entrepreneur Elon Musk is involved with space travel In 2016 his 14 year old SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket made its first landing aboard a drone ship at sea after dropping off cargo to the ISS It marked the first time Musk s company had been able to achieve a successful ocean landing Successful landings also means Musk s company can reuse rockets saving the company money 39 7 Earth size planets found Date Feb 22 2017 In recent years astronomers have made many exciting discoveries of planets beyond our solar system On Feb 22 2017 NASA announced the discovery of planetary system Trappist 1 which contains seven Earth sized planets orbiting a red dwarf star It is about 40 light years from Earth in the constellation Aquarius Scientists determined that three of the planets in the system were found in the habitable zone meaning there is a chance they may have liquid water and an atmosphere that can support life 40 Probing moon and rings Date April 13 2017 In the hunt for extraterrestrial life NASA s Cassini spacecraft mission may have found an interesting possibility beyond the Asteroid Belt One of Saturn s moons Enceladus contains a chemical reaction beneath its icy

season viewing is more about elevation than location Your best chances for spotting color are to get high or get low Higher elevations with panoramic views will allow you to spot smatterings of color in the valleys below Alternatively you can get low marshy areas near bodies of water typically offer the first areas of foliage change and also offer a wide variety of tree species which enlarges the palette of early season colors Helpful Tip Plan Ahead Foliage season is a very popular time to visit Vermont so if you want to stay in a particular place on a particular weekend call in advance to make sure rooms are available Having your lodging plans made in advance will avoid unnecessary stress and allow you to enjoy your foliage season odyssey Also too it is a good idea to make dining reservations as early as possible in the day or even the night before When To Come For Peak Foliage There is no one perfect time to visit Vermont to see peak foliage Color change begins in mid September and runs through the first two to three weeks in October and varies by elevation progressing from north to south and higher to lower elevations during the course of the season As such there are many peaks so that you can make your plans based on the timing and location that works for you Science Behind the Leaves Changing Colors During the short summer months broad leafed trees such as maples oaks and birches produce food to nourish themselves for growth They do this through a process known as photosynthesis using the energy of the sun to produce food As the days grow shorter in early fall the increasing periods of darkness trigger leafy plants to slow down photosynthesis and stop growing A pigment in the leaves called chlorophyll which gives leaves their green color is used in photosynthesis so the slowing of this process means there is less green pigment But leaves contain pigments other than green called carotenoids and anthocyanins Once the greens fade carotenoids are revealed yellow orange and brown colors anthocyanins and are produced red and purple colors Certain colors are characteristic of particular plant species Red maples live up to their name by turning scarlet while most sugar maples glow a warm orange Aspen and birches display sunny yellows while oak and beech leaves turn bronze and gold Most of Vermont s fall foliage color is provided by red and sugar maples two resilient tree species that constitute more than 50 percent of our forest s trees You can find even more details on leaves and their changing colors courtesy of the US Forest Service

unnecessary stress and allow you to enjoy your foliage season odyssey Also too it is a good idea to make dining reservations as early as possible in the day or even the night before When To Come For Peak Foliage There is no one perfect time to visit Vermont to see peak foliage Color change begins in mid September and runs through the first two to three weeks in October and varies by elevation progressing from north to south and higher to lower elevations during the course of the season As such there are many peaks so that you can make your plans based on the timing and location that works for you Science Behind the Leaves Changing Colors During the short summer months broad leafed trees such as maples oaks and birches produce food to nourish themselves for growth They do this through a process known as photosynthesis using the energy of the sun to produce food As the days grow shorter in early fall the increasing periods of darkness trigger leafy plants to slow down photosynthesis and stop growing A pigment in the leaves called chlorophyll which gives leaves their green color is used in photosynthesis so the slowing of this process means there is less green pigment But leaves contain pigments other than green called carotenoids and anthocyanins Once the greens fade carotenoids are revealed yellow orange and brown colors anthocyanins and are produced red and purple colors Certain colors are characteristic of particular plant species Red maples live up to their name by turning scarlet while most sugar maples glow a warm orange Aspen and birches display sunny yellows while oak and beech leaves turn bronze and gold Most of Vermont s fall foliage color is provided by red and sugar maples two resilient tree species that constitute more than 50 percent of our forest s trees You can find even more details on leaves and their changing colors courtesy of the US Forest Service Why Leaves Change Colors Find more info about Fall Foliage in New England from photographer Jeff Foliage Folger Vermont Fall Foliage Season from the Vermont Department of Tourism Please note This is only an approximation of typical foliage color progression The exact timing of the color

       " 'See our research on Supreme Court Social Media COVID 19 See our research on Supreme Court Social Media COVID 19 Sixty years after the founding of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA most Americans believe the United States should be at the forefront of global leadership in space exploration Majorities say the International Space Station has been a good investment for the country and that on balance NASA is still vital to the future of U S space exploration even as private space companies emerge as increasingly important players Roughly seven in ten Americans 72 say it is essential for the U S to continue to be a world leader in space exploration and eight in ten 80 say the space station has been a good investment for the country according to a new Pew Research Center survey conducted March 27 April 9 2018 These survey results come at a time when NASA finds itself in a much different world from the one that existed when the Apollo astronauts first set foot on the moon nearly half a century ago The Cold War space race has receded into history but other countries including China Japan and India have emerged as significant international players in space exploration And as the private sector increasingly ventures into space through companies such as SpaceX Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic 65 of Americans believe NASA should still play a vital role in the exploration of space while a third 33 say private companies will ensure enough progress in this area even without NASA s involvement Strong public support that the U S should continue to be at the vanguard of space exploration is widely shared across gender educational and political groups Each generational group for example expresses nearly equal levels of strong support for continued U S space leadership from Baby Boomer and older generations 71 who lived through the Right Stuff era that pioneered space exploration to Millennials 70 who grew up during the space shuttle program Indeed on most issues regarding NASA and space exploration there are no more than modest differences among the generational cohorts See the Appendix for details Similarly majorities across gender generation education and political groups see benefits from government investment in one of NASA s signature projects the International Space Station ISS The findings support for the U S being at the forefront of space exploration and the perception that the space station has been a good investment are broadly consistent with previous Pew Research Center surveys which used somewhat different wording and polling methods While the ISS has proven to be an enduring legacy of the U S space program it is also emblematic of changing times NASA currently relies in part on the Dragon spacecraft built and operated by Elon Musk s SpaceX company to deliver supplies to the orbiting laboratory And the Trump administration has been exploring the possibility of turning the space station into a commercially run venture after 2024 As Americans consider the future of the U S space program most 65 still see an essential role for NASA while a third 33 believe private companies will ensure that enough progress is made in space exploration even without NASA s involvement Democrats and independents who lean Democratic are more likely than Republicans and independents who lean Republican to believe that NASA should continue to play a role in space exploration 70 vs 59 Conservative Republicans are closely divided on this issue 53 to 47 though two thirds 67 of moderate or liberal Republicans believe a continued role for NASA in U S space exploration is essential NASA oversees a diverse portfolio of space related missions from sending robotic probes to explore distant planets to launching satellites that study Earth s atmosphere and oceans When asked to rate the importance of nine of these missions majorities of Americans say a top priority for NASA should be monitoring key parts of the Earth s climate system 63 or monitoring asteroids and other objects that could potentially collide with the Earth 62 Slightly fewer than half of Americans 47 believe that conducting basic scientific research to increase knowledge and understanding of space should be a top priority with 40 saying such research is an important but lower priority Some 41 say developing technologies that could be adapted for uses other than space exploration should be a top priority and 44 characterize it as an important but lower priority for NASA And 38 believe NASA should make it a top priority to conduct scientific research on how space travel affects human health while 41 see it as an important but lower priority Around one third of U S adults say that searching for raw materials and natural resources that could be used on Earth 34 or searching for life and planets that could support life 31 should be top priorities 22 and 27 of Americans say respectively that these missions are not too important or shouldn t be pursued Missions for human astronauts to explore Mars and return to the moon are among NASA s most high profile programs The Trump administration has expressed strong support for these initiatives saying that exploring the solar system should be NASA s core mission beginning with a return of astronauts to the moon However compared with other NASA programs fewer Americans say such space exploration should be a top priority Just 18 and 13 respectively say that sending astronauts to Mars or back to the moon should be a top priority 37 and 44 respectively express the view that these missions are not too important or that NASA shouldn t undertake these missions Some space experts argue that the life support systems required to sustain astronauts on a long interplanetary journey would be so expensive that it would be more cost effective to send robotic probes 1 With regards to future expeditions into space a majority of Americans say they would consider it essential that humans not solely robots make the trip Overall 58 of U S adults believe it is essential to include the use of human astronauts in the U S space program while 41 say astronauts are not essential Republicans and Democrats tend to agree about the relative priorities of NASA s efforts For example about six in ten of each party say that monitoring asteroids should be a top priority for NASA 61 of Republicans and 63 of Democrats including those who lean to each party But Republicans tend to put monitoring the Earth s climate system as a lower priority for the agency consistent with long standing political divides over climate issues Fewer Republicans and Republican leaning independents 44 than Democrats and Democratic leaners 78 believe that monitoring the Earth s climate system should be a top priority for NASA Some 38 of Republicans say that monitoring the Earth s climate system should be an important but lower priority and 17 say this is not too important or should not be done Republicans are also less likely than Democrats to see basic scientific research to further knowledge of space as a top priority Some 38 of Republicans and those who lean to the GOP consider this a top priority for NASA while 46 call it an important but lower priority About half 53 of Democrats and leaners consider basic scientific research a top priority for the agency The new survey finds men more likely than women to consider several of these missions a top priority for NASA including conducting basic scientific research 54 of men vs 40 of women say this should be a top priority While a minority considers putting astronauts in space a top priority for NASA more men 25 than women 11 consider human exploration of Mars a top priority In addition while about half or more of men and women believe human astronauts are essential for the U S space program more men 63 than women 54 hold this view This finding is in keeping with a 2014 Pew Research Center survey which used somewhat different question wording and polling methods Also see Appendix for views on these issues by gender Men also tend to express more interest in space and astronomy news according to a 2017 Pew Research Center survey as well as surveys conducted for this year s Science and Engineering Indicators report There are no more than modest differences by education level in agency priorities One exception is that those with at least a postgraduate degree are more likely than those with high school or less education to consider basic scientific research a top priority for NASA 63 vs 38 See Appendix for details Private companies such as SpaceX Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic continue to develop space exploration capabilities that were once the sole purview of government agencies such as NASA Some 44 of Americans have a great deal of confidence these companies will make a profit in their space related ventures with 36 saying they are fairly confident that space companies will be profitable Although most Americans believe that NASA still has an essential role to play in the exploration of space they also express confidence that private companies can make meaningful contributions in such areas as developing safe spacecraft and conducting research to expand scientific knowledge For instance about one in four Americans say they have a great deal of confidence that private companies will build safe and reliable rockets and spacecraft 26 and around half of Americans 51 have at least a fair amount of confidence that space companies will be able to do so Americans are by and large confident about the ability of private companies to control the costs of developing rockets and spacecraft 24 have a great deal of confidence and 41 have a fair amount of confidence compared with 34 who have not too much confidence or no confidence at all Moreover 23 have a great deal of confidence and 47 have a fair amount of confidence that companies will conduct basic research to increase knowledge of space compared with 29 who don t have much confidence or have no confidence at all Americans however tend to be skeptical about whether private companies will minimize human made space debris which increasingly poses a hazard to orbiting satellites and space stations Only 13 of U S adults have a great deal of confidence that companies will minimize that problem with 35 saying they have a fair amount of confidence By comparison about half of Americans 51 have not too much or no confidence that private companies will minimize human made space debris Men express more confidence than women in private space companies abilities in most of these areas particularly when it comes to building cost effective and safe spacecraft For example 74 of men but 56 of women have at least a fair amount of confidence these companies will control costs and 85 of men vs 69 of women have at least a fair amount of confidence that private companies will build safe and reliable spacecraft A small share of the public just 7 is particularly attentive to space news saying they have heard a lot about NASA in the past year and a lot about private space companies About a fifth of Americans 22 have heard nothing at all about both of these while most Americans 71 fall in between these two extremes having heard at least a little either about NASA or about private companies developing space exploration capabilities 2 Those most attentive to space news stand out from other Americans for their strong support for the U S being a world leader in space exploration and their belief that the International Space Station has been a good investment for the country For instance 88 of those who have heard a lot of space news believe it is essential for the U S to be a global leader in space exploration compared with 60 of those who have heard nothing about NASA and private space companies And 94 of the most space attentive Americans consider the space station to have been a good investment for the country compared with 67 of those who have heard nothing about space news When thinking about priorities for NASA Americans who are highly attentive to space news put more priority than other Americans on research missions such as basic scientific research and learning about the health effects of space travel For example three quarters 75 of those highly attentive to space news believe basic scientific research should be a top priority for NASA versus 31 of those with low attention to such news Indeed the share of this space attentive group that considers basic research a top priority is similar to the shares who say the same about monitoring objects in space that could collide with Earth 69 and monitoring the climate system 68 But while those who pay a lot of attention to space news tend to put more priority than other Americans on NASA s research missions they are more closely divided than other Americans over the importance of NASA s role in space exploration going forward Among the most attentive 55 say it is essential that NASA continue to be involved in U S space exploration while 45 say private companies will ensure enough progress even without NASA s involvement Among other Americans the balance of opinion leans more clearly toward NASA remaining involved For example 66 of those who pay a medium level of attention to space news say it is essential for NASA to remain involved as do 68 of those with low attention to space news Those who have heard a lot about space news also tend to express more confidence in private space companies to handle key aspects of space exploration especially building safe and cost effective spacecraft For example 95 of Americans who are most attentive to news about NASA and private space companies have at least a fair amount of confidence that those companies will build safe and reliable rockets and spacecraft 58 of this group has a great deal of confidence in companies to do this By comparison 60 of those who have heard nothing about NASA and private space companies have at least a fair amount of confidence in private companies to build safe and reliable spacecraft Space tourism A majority of Americans say it s not for them but 63 of Millennials are interested Americans expect a range of scientific and technological developments ahead But the public is divided over the prospects for space tourism in the next 50 years Half 50 believe this will happen while half are skeptical this will be routine for ordinary people About a third of Americans 32 believe that colonies on other planets habitable for long periods of time will be built by the year 2068 while two thirds 67 doubt this will happen As the public considers the possibilities ahead for ordinary citizens to orbit the Earth in a spacecraft more Americans say they would not want to orbit the Earth than say they would 58 to 42 Interest in orbiting the Earth is greater among younger generations men and those who are more attentive to space news Some 63 of Millennials born 1981 to 1996 say they are definitely or probably interested in space tourism compared with 39 of Gen Xers born 1965 to 1980 and 27 of those in the Baby Boomer or older generations Across all generations men are more likely than women 51 vs 33 to say they are interested in traveling into space as tourists Those who have heard or read a lot about NASA and private space companies are much more likely 74 to say they are interested in space tourism than those who have heard nothing about such space news 30 Among the 42 of Americans who would be interested in traveling into space 45 of them say the main reason for their interest would be to experience something unique Some 29 of this group say they would go so that they can see the view of Earth from space while 20 want to learn more about the world The 58 of U S adults who say they wouldn t want to orbit the Earth aboard a spacecraft believe that such a trip would be either too expensive 28 of those asked or too scary 28 or that their age or health wouldn t allow it 28 Some 16 of those not interested in space travel offered reasons other than the three options in the survey Those most attentive to space news stand out from other Americans for their strong support for the U S being a world leader in space exploration and their belief that the

just a few But perhaps the most memorable moment of fall is the changing of the leaves as trees suddenly burst with hues of fiery red and orange and warm yellow and gold Across the country people marvel at the dazzling colors that seem to emerge overnight and fade just as quickly as the leaves fall and winter arrives If you want to catch the brightest fall foliage you have to plan ahead to know where to travel and when to view the best fall leaves We ve prepared a list of the best places to see fall leaves and when you can see them at their peak beauty The key to the best fall foliage viewing is to catch the leaves at their peak colors but before too many fall In general leaves will change earlier in regions that are cooler including northern regions and mountainous areas They begin to change in Canada where the weather is colder then progress south in two major waves Most leaves across the country will peak and fall in October but this golden time frame will vary in different regions Weather also impacts exactly when leaves peak in color each year with dry days and cool nights producing the best and fullest fall foliage If you want to head up to the Northeast to view foliage plan for peak leaf colors in mid October In the most northern regions of New England leaves may peak in late September or early October The Midwest also features peak foliage around mid October with northern regions featuring peak leaves early in the month of October If you re traveling out West plan to see peak leaves in early or mid October with northern regions peaking later in the month Leaves in the South peak last with the best fall foliage viewing from late October to mid November After the leaves peak they will begin to fall about a week later so the time frame is brief for the best leaf viewing While specific dates will vary each year this fall foliage map is a good gauge of when you can plan to view the best leaf colors No matter where you want to travel for leaf peeping with the right planning you can see the best and brightest leaves this autumn If you hope to maximize your leaf peeping trip call ahead to the park or area you are visiting to ask about the leaf conditions Many parks will release fall foliage forecasts so you can plan your trip for exactly when the leaves are predicted to peak in that region Planning is a good idea but you should always strive to be flexible too if you arrive at your intended destination and the leaves are not yet in peak color you may be able to head a little further north or to a higher elevation for better foliage viewing Whether you want to travel far or stay close to home you can find beautiful fall foliage in any region While some people prefer to go to remote areas for natural foliage viewing some of the best leaves can also be found near major cities and towns Below you ll find some of the most popular places to view fall foliage in every region of the U S New England is one of the most popular regions for viewing fall foliage and rightfully so Its winding scenic roads and abundance of gorgeous mountain peaks make it an ideal location for leaf peeping whether you want to drive hike or simply

applying its crewed space mission expertise to longer stays among the stars Lockheed Martin teamed with Nanoracks and its parent company Voyager Space to build and operate the first ever continuously crewed free flying commercial space station Starlab dedicated to conducting critical research fostering industrial activity and ensuring continued U S presence and leadership in low Earth orbit NASA recently announced the Commercial Low Earth Orbit Destination CLD project to support the development of private space stations Nanoracks will lead the Starlab team in competing for the CLD project With aging infrastructure in orbit the project expands options for humans living in space Starlab leverages Lockheed Martin s experience in long endurance space missions crewed spaceflight and

       " ' About the time the fireworks are shooting off in small towns across Central Oregon a few keen fly fisher s are watching the counts of Steelhead trickle up through the dams on the mighty Columbia By the 4th of July there are likely enough fish in the system to make the first trip on the lower Deschutes but the best is certainly yet to come With our Steelhead season running from early July until New Years Eve you have 6 months and over 100 miles of river to chase them It s an incredible fishery really unmatched in overall experience by most standards Early season Steelhead are typically wild and hot fish that are destined for the Deschutes Beginning in Early July and going through the first week or two of September the section of river from Mack s Canyon to the Columbia is where to focus on the run This 23 mile section of the river is accessed several ways by drift boat or raft floating down river or by powerful jet sled s that operate coming up from the mouth or down from Mack s Canyon Still others hike or ride Mountain Bikes up and down the east side trails with the hope of finding great water full of migratory fish Camping out along the river is basic dry and dusty With summer winds whipping up the Columbia River Gorge be prepared for afternoon winds that can really howl Some days the winds interfere with casting and boating and make it a challenge to pitch a tent But when the fish are running none of that matters The focus is on the fish By August the migratory counts coming up over Bonneville Dam and the Dalles Dam are really increasing and the Deschutes will see many more fish taking the right turn up river Curiously they are not all Deschutes fish but many Idaho bound fish will come up the Deschutes and stay for a while We see stray fish swimming up the Deschutes usually about 10 to 15 miles before they turn around to go back to the Columbia for their trek East That said strays might swim 90 miles up and decide to stay or finally turn around to seek out there own home waters About Mid August enough Steelhead are heading up the Deschutes that the push of fish finally gets above Mack s Canyon There is a section of river below Sherars Falls that has good road access for fly fisher s driving the rocky road down to Mack s Canyon Campground from the town of Maupin Oregon In addition to the road access there are a couple of great float options that open up a lot of water to fish for a day or two Floats are typically done from either Beavertail or Pine Tree down to Mack s Canyon where the road ends We hit this section hard from Mid August until the Middle of October as the fish pile up river There are good opportunities for Steelhead through here all the way through the end of the year By Mid to Late September the Steelhead have begun to pass Sherars Falls and are getting above Maupin in good numbers The 3 day drift from Trout Creek to Harpham Flats is a good choice not only for Steelhead but also quite good for a Steelhead Trout combo trip So far these fish are running at a time of pretty great weather in Central Oregon and water temperatures are conducive to smaller swinging patterns like Freight Trains Green Butt Skunks Steelhead Shimmers Night Dancers and Fly Dejours just to name a few shop favorites We exclusively Spey Cast to Steelhead these days using 12 to 13 1 2 foot rods for 6 or 7 weights Most days a Scandi Head fly line is a great choice for casting these flies but on days with more wind the Airflo Rage line paired with a Airflo 10 foot Intermediate Poly Leader is a huge advantage With Fall Steelheading just around the corner colder and longer nights usher in October By this time the Steelhead have arrived all the way up to the Warm Springs area so there are now Steelhead to be found in 100 miles of river As the river becomes colder there are more tactics to employ that will add to your Steelhead success The smaller patterns can still be swung on a Scandi or Rage head or you might need to go deep with a big fly like a Town Run Cold Medicine or Intruder When you go with a big fly it s a good idea to change out the head to an aggressive Skagit Taper paired with a Sink Tip of either the Rio MOW tip or an Airflo Custom Cut Tip to keep the fly swinging low slow October and November weather is usually very agreeable to get out and fish Days are typically still dry and afternoon temperatures get up to the 50 s pretty often By November the crowds are gone with kids back in school football to watch hunting season and holidays coming It is a favorite time of ours to be on the water Usually by this time of year we are swinging big flies on Skagit lines with MOW tips or nymphing slow and deep Great fall fishing can be found at Warm Springs Mecca Trout Creek South Junction Nena to Wapinitia and Beavertail to Mack s Canyon December can be a pretty cold month around here but the beat marches on when it comes to Steelhead Float fishing is a great possibility but the days are short so a lot of just drive to an area and walk and wade for a few hours Like Fall fishing getting deep either by swinging a heavy sinking tip or dead drifting a big ol nymph rig will get you down to the fish Watch the weather and you can still be seeing fireworks in December Some people look down on Nymphing for Steelhead There are traditionalist in any game but the guys who only swing are missing a good bet for catching fish especially in the Fall and early Winter There is a combination of flies we ve found at the shop that really seems to work above all others Take a 9 2x Rio Fluorocarbon leader and a 4 or 6 Double Bead Peacock Speckled Stone we call it a Cheeseburger in the store Tie a dropper of 3x Rio Fluoroflex tippet 24 inches off the bend of the Cheeseburger and tie on any number of great droppers Our favorites include the Steelhead Lightning Bug Tungsten Flash Prince Double Agent Rusty Bucket and Copper Bob Set up the nymph rig with a Sindacator or one of our Slip Strike Indicators that come apart and slide down the leader allowing you to reel up without the worry of the indicator hitting the tip of the rod It s a great way to fish To view Steelhead

       " ' Sharing is caring Steelhead are at the top of sought after game fish in western North America As ocean going rainbow trout steelhead are anadromous meaning they migrate from the rivers and creeks they hatch in and move into the ocean or large water then returning as much larger fish to the rivers where they hatched to spawn The Great Lakes have transplanted steelhead that run up the rivers in the area whereas the Pacific Northwest PNW and other parts of the West are home to native ocean run steelhead If you d like to pinpoint rivers near you that offer the best steelhead fishing stick around until later in this article and we ll link you to articles that will point your car in the right direction Steelhead tend to stay in the rivers they are hatched in for a time before starting their migration sometimes nearing the size of typical trout before leaving their birth streams A defining characteristic of steelhead is their size compared to typical rainbow trout Steelhead eat well in the ocean which helps them outpace their river cousins in size When they migrate to the ocean they lose their bright rainbow coloring and become more silvery similar to salmon in the ocean Once they have been back in the freshwater rivers for a little while they start regaining their brighter patterns If you target a species based on its ability to fight steelhead should be high on your list These muscular trout are acrobatic strong and full of energy They can definitely wear you out after a productive day s fishing In some areas including the Pacific Northwest there are two primarily steelhead runs each year Some steelhead make their return to the rivers in the summer while others migrate home during the winter We will focus on the differences in runs later Steelhead are native to the West Coast from California to Alaska and in many areas their numbers are supplemented by hatchery programs to increase harvest opportunities Steelhead also have been introduced to the Great Lakes region and have flourished there Keep in mind that these fish are notoriously difficult to catch Some anglers call steelhead the Fish of 1 000 Casts Be prepared for days when you just can t hook one When West Coast steelhead return to spawn they can be found in many tributary rivers along the coast Some also can travel quite far with rivers as far inland as Idaho having excellent steelhead runs Targeting specific waters for steelhead takes planning research and patience Read as much as you can on specific river systems to understand the timing and techniques used in these waters Some rivers have both summer and winter runs of steelhead while many rivers will have one or the other Both summer and winter runs typically spawn in the spring However the summer run enters rivers much earlier than winter runs where they begin to act more like resident trout as reach spawning maturity Rivers holding steelhead are abundant as are the anglers searching their banks Some of the best spots can get extremely crowded When approaching groups of anglers fishing the same hole you re interested in make sure you use proper etiquette Don t cast over others don t wade out into the hole where others are fishing and finally don t be a jerk Choosing the right water will make all the difference Steelhead prefer rocky or gravelly areas with current that are at least a few feet deep Boulders and rocky areas are going to hold more fish than areas without any cover Steelhead holding in shallower water also like some riffles on the top of the stream to make them harder to spot If there are boulders and large rocks in the river try bouncing your bait or lure off the rocks and into the pockets often found behind rocks You might find one right there waiting Another good place to try is where the water slows right after a sizeable rapid moving section of the river They may hold in the calm water to rest and prepare for the run through the rapids ahead Take the time to research your chosen river before getting your feet wet Spending too much time on a non productive section or system can ruin an otherwise excellent fishing trip We already have articles pointing you to the best steelhead rivers in California Oregon and Washington See the links at the bottom of this article The steelhead of the Great Lakes region have their own runs that can see 50 000 75 000 stacked up in rivers The St Joseph River in Michigan and Indiana is one of the highest rated in the area but don t overlook the Niagara River in New York and Ontario Canada for some pretty stellar numbers as well Steelhead can hold up in many different sections of the waterway However the where and why of finding fish in each section can be difficult to decode Rivers and creeks all have at least some similar characteristics Riffles and rapids are universal You will find a beginning or top riffle a middle section which slows down into a pool and a tailwater Every run has these three characteristics They may not be present in even amounts but they are there The top of a run will present with shallower water a rock base and a steeper angle than lower down The faster riffle and current can provide some secure areas for steelhead especially if the water levels are lower and they can nose up into the upper pool areas to hide under current and behind rocks When the fish are actively running in the earlier part of the season you also can at times focus on these areas to target them as they move through Always match the speed of the water in the section you are fishing A tip I like when evaluating water is that steelhead often hold in water that is moving at about the speed I walk The middle sections where water pools and gets deeper at times can be the money spot depending on the day Deep sections are often best if the fish need to rest or if the top and bottom of a pool are too shallow for steelhead to feel secure These deeper sections are going to provide a slower current naturally formed cover and perhaps larger groups of fish holding in the water together If the pools are widening out try testing the underwater ledges along the edges of the run Try to bounce off the bottom as lightly as possible in these sections to avoid snags Remember you want to focus on fishing not re rigging your rod every 10 minutes Fish the centerline then edge out toward the bank a little each time you pass through Cover as much of the water as possible Winter run steelies very often tend to hold in the the tail waters of pools often called tail outs Tail outs are generally right below the pools and above the next downstream rapids usually between the shallowest and lowest part of the pool and the deeper sections up above Tail sections can be super productive for some techniques we ll tell you about but they lack accessibility for side drifting from a boat The water tends to get relatively shallow as it moves back into rapids again During times of low water these may be inaccessible to boats making the bank anglers happy Cast from as far a distance as possible in these sections Fish can be easily spooked here Cast towards or above structure or other spots you think hold fish anticipating the steelies to be hanging out below boulders You may be able to sight fish for steelhead especially in tail outs and runs that are waist deep or less Watch your lure or bait as you move it through the water as sometimes you ll see a steelhead flash sideways to get a look Even if that fish doesn t strike it might the next cast or with another type of lure or bait They say the best time for any fishing is when you can get out there to fish That holds true most of the time but steelhead are trickier when it comes to timing With the different runs happening throughout the year it is possible to get onto a steelhead all year long in some parts of the country That doesn t mean it s a particularly successful trip but if you learn when the runs peak in each river you fish you ll boost your odds considerably The time of day anglers already on the water water conditions and a laundry list of other factors can make or break the best made plans Fly fishing anglers traditionally hold with the notion that the best time is throughout the day Bait and tackle anglers might express an opinion that evenings and very early mornings often securing their fishing spots well before the sun is up are best for bringing in the big ones Each opinion has its merits Let s look more at the timing of each run which is critical to your success It makes sense Fish when there are more fish Summer run steelhead start migrating as early as March and will peak in late spring to early summer in some coastal and shorter streams and rivers By contrast summer steelhead may begin their journeys early in the season but not actually arrive to rivers until much later For example runs that migrate up the Columbia and Snake rivers in the Northwest are often best fished in the fall and even through winter and into early the next spring In the Pacific Northwest steelhead east of the Cascades are part of the summer run while steelhead west of the Cascades can be either winter or summer runs with winter runs common to more west side river systems As we ve mentioned summer steelhead will hold in the rivers and creeks while they reach reproductive maturity before moving into the spawning beds This makes them available for fishing for longer sometimes half the year or so in some locations Winter runs are comprised primarily of steelhead that are closer to spawning than the summer run The winter run starts in late fall and continues into spring in some rivers overlapping with the early summer run fish These winter steelhead spawn sooner after entering their home range In many rivers the winter steelhead can average a bit larger than summer fish but there are some exceptionally large specimens of summer steelhead out there as well Targeting winter run steelhead in some rivers can yield larger catches while the summer run definitely will yield more comfortable fishing conditions and sometimes less angling competition Keep in mind that steelhead are able to spawn more than once unlike their salmon cousins While it s thought to be a fairly small percentage of steelhead that survive become two salt fish with a second successful migration these older steelhead have the potential to be the giants of 20 pounds or better The eggs that are deposited in steelhead redds will emerge as fry in the summer The fry remain in freshwater for two to three years before heading out to sea where they spend another two or three years but put on a lot more weight Alaskan steelhead migrating timeframes are much narrower than more southerly climates For example In the southern Kenai Peninsula steelhead stack the creeks and rivers throughout the fall Once temperatures drop off fishing becomes far more difficult Still until that point these fish can be much more aggressive than their southern counterparts With a shorter window to feed and spawn they take full advantage The Great Lakes region has an active fall to winter run that fills the local rivers and creeks with mature fish ready to spawn On some rivers the locals muse that it s rarer to catch a steelhead under 8 pounds than it is to catch a 20 pounder Selecting the proper gear for steelhead fishing is vital Rods need to be fairly long and strong enough for these fish Let s take a look at what tackle you should have then break down some specific methods There are several steelhead salmon spinning rods on the market Determine your preferred method then select the appropriate rod If bank fishing make sure your rod is long enough to keep the line out of the water as much as you can Drift fishing is a pretty common tactic for bank anglers so a longer setup is necessary You don t want the flow to carry your line unnaturally Typical steelhead rod lengths are in the neighborhood 8 to 9 feet for bank casting but for some purposes longer rods will do well Casting rods and reels are also very popular options especially among drift and boat anglers Depending on your approach you ll want to decide which type is going to work best for you If you hire a fishing guide they typically will provide gear for your trip and using their equipment will give you a pretty good idea of what works best for you and your fishing techniques Remember that outfitters and bait shops are your allies They want you to catch fish and be successful so you will come back and see them again Ask experts for recommendations on baits colors depths and if they have any specific areas for you to try out Steelhead are fighters and will thoroughly test your line Make sure you have a good quality fluorocarbon with a monofilament leader Braid doesn t have any stretch to it and many steelheaders prefer it for their main lines Opinions vary widely on the strength of line to use Some believe an 8 pound or even lighter leader is perfect especially in clear water conditions Others wouldn t think of using anything under 10 to 12 pounds for starters with heavier lines in the mix Heavier tackle is going to make actually landing a steelhead a little bit easier since you ll have the line strength to slow them down but you have to fool them into striking in the first place Let s take a closer look at several the tactics you can use to be a productive steelhead angler Keep in mind that steelhead aren t going to leap into your boat or throw themselves at your feet on the bank You might need multiple trips before you catch your first one More anglers go home without a steelhead than catch Hopefully we can help you improve those odds a little with some tips on tactics Drift fishing is one of the most common and popular options for bringing a steelie to the net While drift fishing is primarily a bank tactic it can be done from a boat as well Baits of salmon roe sand shrimp and soft plastics are the norm when drifting Using Corkies and or yarn will add an extra attractor and the tiny floats also help keep the bait at the right depth right above the bottom The setup is pretty simple Use just enough weight to have your line tick off the bottom and flow naturally in the current Many drift anglers will use a small bait sac to hold the roe in with a 2 0 hook depending on the water Cast upstream above your primary target area allowing the bait to flow down into the zone naturally It should occasionally bounce off the bottom Once it starts dragging during much of the drift retrieve and cast back upstream The longer the bait is naturally drifting just above the bottom the better Side drifting is a slightly modified version of the standard drift When boat fishing this can be an excellent option The bait just needs to be suspended and drifting naturally along with the boat and water speeds Plunking is basically still fishing in current with bait It seems aptly named as you just plunk the bait out there into likely holding water and hope for a bite Rigging this technique is pretty straightforward with more weight required to hold the bait in place than with drift fishing High waters are often the best reason to choose this method because drift fishing and other steelhead techniques tend to get less effective when there is a muddy hue in the water while a still piece of bait can still convince fish to bite Action can be good if you are able to find the right lanes in the water Steelhead will take the easiest path up the river that still keeps them relatively hidden so it often pays to concentrate on the sides of the swifter channels The water that runs slower than the main flow will likely hold more fish when the river levels are high and fish are looking for places to rest out of the heavy current Fishing for steelhead with a bobber and bait or jig works much the same as when you started fishing for bluegill or trout The bobber lets you cover a lot of water and it has the added advantage of often keeping your hook just above the unwanted snags while still in front of the fish Let s look at some of the tactics used when bobber fishing Jigs float under the bobber with the hook facing up They back toward the waiting fish and the hookset seldom slips When fishing murky or cloudy water especially during colder conditions brightly colored jigs tend to draw more strikes There are a variety of types of steelhead jigs ranging from dyed feathers to soft plastics Larger more flashy jigs are perfect for when there is low visibility in the rivers due to storm run off Some anglers will tip their jig hooks with bait to add to the attraction Clear water conditions can be exciting because if you watch closely you might see the steelie set after the jig They may travel quite a way to snag one Speaking from experience it s a good idea to approach fishing areas carefully and perhaps behind the fish during such clearwater conditions that you ll often find in the summer but also during dry spells in the winter Steelhead spook easily I like a darker jig in clear water especially in the summer Blacks purples and similar colors often with just a small dash of color like bright pink work well in those conditions On the flip side bright pinks oranges and chartreuse will often be the best colors when the water is cold and murky as it often is during the winter Jig fishing allows you to put the bait right in the strike zone from the beginning of the cast to the end The hook being weighted is a significant advantage over other techniques and approaches The setup uses a spinning rod between 8 and 11 feet with a monofilament leader and fluorocarbon mainline For winter fishing the leader test should be between 8 and 12 pounds or so and the mainline should be slightly stronger perhaps in the 15 to 20 pound range Lighten up your tackle for clear conditions often found with summertime steelhead fishing Some use braid line though it may not break off causing your rod to break instead Bobber fishing for steelhead with soft plastics is always a great option Use tubes worms roe clusters trout worms creature baits and other types plastics work great on steelies sometimes even when they are designed for other game fish species Carrying a good range of options will allow you to move through the water with several different presentations in short order There are scented plastic roe imitations on the market that are always a great option to keep on hand Try to present these the same as when using a salmon roe bait sac With soft plastics shaped like worms plan on 2 to 4 inch sizes Try a variety of baits until you find the one they are interested in that day Mimic the local natural fare Crawfish bloodworms and mousetails might bring a fish to net Check out the glow baits that are available These give off a faint to strong glowing presence under the water drawing steelies in at night where legal and in murky cloudy water The best natural steelhead baits to fish under bobbers resemble their typical meals We ve already mentioned salmon roe In some areas closer to the coast sand shrimp are a very popular steelhead bait option and prawn or crayfish tails are occasionally used But let s not forget Nightcrawlers should never be underestimated as a steelhead fishing bait There are times that every bait presented to steelies will bring nothing but frustration while the guy standing 50 feet away is bringing them in hand over fist with live worms I ve been that guy especially fishing for summer runs and I ve been the guy looking at that guy That guy probably spent 2 99 for a great day s fishing while you spent upwards of 50 to 60 on new plastics lures jig heads and plugs Throw in a dozen nightcrawlers with those other lures and you ll find the 62 99 to be money well spent Spinner and spoon fishing can sometimes be the deadliest technique for steelhead fishing especially from the shore but also from a boat They also have the advantage of being simple to carry and use and fishing with these types of lures allows you to cover lots of water Spinners and spoons are so popular that several more experienced anglers have started making their own variants to catch steelies and salmon While you might very well catch fish with these methods used in the wrong way or in in the wrong circumstances you ll end up feeding the river valuable tackle and getting nothing but frustration When casting don t just flip it straight out Read the water Look at depth levels and where the pools and eddies start Remember that in shallow water your spoon or lure will drop through the strike zone pretty fast To compensate at times it will work better cast at an angle pointed downstream Shallow water upstream is going to be expensive Stay away The same strategy works with smallies in rivers Don t go upstream in shallow water You ll lose the lure for sure My advice is to really tailor your lure size to the fishing circumstances If the lure sinks into the rocks and snags too quickly switch to a smaller spinner or spoon Conversely in heavier water you will want a larger lure that will occasionally contact the bottom but not so heavy that it drags and snags with every cast As with jig fishing I like to tailor my lure colors and sizes to the water conditions Often darker lures in tarnished brass black or other dark finishes will work great in the summer and sometimes with low winter flows I like the bright silver or brass finishes during the winter often with bright beads or stickers to add some color While some steelhead anglers have taken to casting bass type plugs from the bank plug fishing is frequently a boat tactic There are different techniques from wrapping the plug with a fillet of baitfish or using plugs that resemble bass plugs and wobble irresistibly Let s break down the KwikFish or Flatfish style of plugs Rigging these can be a bit more advanced than most other techniques A jet diver can be rigged off a three joint swivel or two barrel swivels with a bead in the middle The second tailing line holds the KwikFish This is often a great approach to salmon fishing that will also result in steelhead strikes when there are overlapping runs Hotshots are also quite often used for boat fishing for steelhead and are among the professional guides go to techniques These lures look like bass lures but have a single treble hook at the back instead of the multiple hooks usually found on a bass lure These lures provide a significant amount of action even in slow current bringing in even the wariest of steelies Then again they can also scare off every fish within a mile It really depends on depth retrieval speeds and the mood of the steelhead Look for the brighter colors that are typically associated with salmon but also keep a few in more muted colors in your box as well Anchor fishing is a technique that has boat anglers anchoring and casting into current flows likely to hold fish Lures are cast out and allowed to run down the current where they are held in likely fish holding spots or migration lanes There are both weighted and lighter spoons and lures to choose from and each has its merits Lighter versions have more action in the current though weighted versions will stay closer to the strike zone longer Look for brighter colors like you would for salmon fishing just a tad smaller This is a type of steelhead fishing to consider in limited locations For example in slower deeper sections of the Columbia Snake and some other rivers that have been dammed into reservoirs but have fish ladders that allow the steelhead in trolling has taken hold Slow trolling with wobbling plugs spinners and spoons can be incredibly effective when the fish are aggressively biting Try using planer boards to keep the bait at the right depth while also adding some flashers to the line providing a good amount of color and flash to bring the fish close enough to see your lure and strike Other options are using plugs diving rapalas and other standard trolling baits but in various steelhead sizes and colors Ponds will occasionally receive the gift of stocked excess hatchery steelhead Mostly done in the winter when the ponds also have cool enough water for these fish to survive long enough to be caught these fish will be active and provide a fun experience Bobber fishing with bait or trolling with lures tend to be productive The number of ponds and lakes these are planted in are pretty limited and we tend to cover these fisheries in our individual location articles you can find throughout this website Steelhead have been known to tire out a fly angler pretty quickly Whether that is from the fast action or from its difficulty is up for debate But one thing is certain If you hook a steelhead on a fly you won t forget it Expect several heart stopping leaps and arm shaking runs Fly fishing for steelhead is a bit more common to see with summer steelhead but don t discount winter fishing for these battlers A preferred technique used with steelhead fly fishing is with a Spey rod as it has the length and backbone to handle these feisty fish Cast angles to cover as much of the run as possible then step a few feet upriver and do it again Bring some colorful streamers and an assortment of other wet flies to bring them to net It is possible to have a non stop action filled day but it is as common to get completely skunked Patience and proficient casting is bound to bring a steelie to net eventually At worst you may just have to try again soon That doesn t sound so bad does it Ready fo find your own steelhead Try these resources on our website Best Steelhead Fishing in California Best Steelhead Fishing in

gravity to reach orbital velocities paving the way for space exploration to become a reality In the 1930s and 1940s Nazi Germany saw the possibilities of using long distance rockets as weapons Late in World War II London was attacked by 200 mile range V 2 missiles which arched 60 miles high over the English Channel at more than 3 500 miles per hour After World War II the United States and the Soviet Union created their own missile programs On Oct 4 1957 the Soviets launched the first artificial satellite Sputnik 1 into space Four years later on April 12 1961 Russian Lt Yuri Gagarin became the first human to orbit Earth in Vostok 1 His flight lasted 108 minutes and Gagarin reached an altitude of 327 kilometers about 202 miles The first U S satellite Explorer 1 went into orbit on Jan 31 1958 In 1961 Alan Shepard became the first American to fly into space On Feb 20 1962 John Glenn s historic flight made him the first American to orbit Earth Landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth within a decade was a national goal set by President John F Kennedy in 1961 On July 20 1969 astronaut Neil Armstrong took one giant leap for mankind as he stepped onto the moon Six Apollo missions were made to explore the moon between 1969 and 1972 During the 1960s unmanned spacecraft photographed and probed the moon before astronauts ever landed By the early 1970s orbiting communications and navigation satellites were in everyday use and the Mariner spacecraft was orbiting and mapping the surface of Mars By the end of the decade the Voyager spacecraft had sent back detailed images of Jupiter and Saturn their rings and their moons Skylab America s first space station was a human spaceflight highlight of the 1970s as was the Apollo Soyuz Test Project the world s first internationally crewed American and Russian space mission In the 1980s satellite communications expanded to carry television programs and people were able to pick up the satellite signals on their home dish antennas Satellites discovered an ozone hole over Antarctica pinpointed forest fires and gave us photographs of the nuclear power plant disaster at Chernobyl in 1986 Astronomical satellites found new stars and gave us a new view of the center of our galaxy In April 1981 the launch of the space shuttle Columbia ushered in a period of reliance on the reusable shuttle for most civilian and military space missions Twenty four successful shuttle launches fulfilled many scientific and military requirements until Jan 28 1986 when just 73 seconds after liftoff the space shuttle Challenger exploded The crew of seven was killed including Christa McAuliffe a teacher from New Hampshire who would have been the first civilian in space The Columbia disaster was the second shuttle tragedy On Feb 1 2003 the shuttle broke apart while reentering the Earth s atmosphere killing all seven crew members The disaster occurred over Texas and only minutes before it was scheduled to land at the Kennedy Space Center An investigation determined the catastrophe was caused by a piece of foam insulation that broke off the shuttle s propellant tank and damaged the edge of the shuttle s left wing It was the second loss of a shuttle in 113 shuttle flights After each of the disasters space shuttle flight operations were suspended for more than two years Discovery was the first of the three active space shuttles to be retired completing its final mission on March 9 2011 Endeavour did so on June 1 The final shuttle mission was completed with the landing of Atlantis on July 21 2011 closing the 30 year space shuttle program The Gulf War proved the value of satellites in modern conflicts During this war allied forces were able to use their control of the high ground of space to achieve a decisive advantage Satellites were used to provide information on enemy troop formations and movements early warning of enemy missile attacks and precise navigation in the featureless desert terrain The advantages of satellites allowed the coalition forces to quickly bring the war to a conclusion saving many lives Space systems continue to become more and more integral to homeland defense weather surveillance communication navigation imaging and remote sensing for chemicals fires and other disasters The International Space Station is a research laboratory in low Earth orbit With many different partners contributing to its design and construction this high flying laboratory has become a symbol of cooperation in space exploration with former competitors now working together The station has been continuously occupied since the arrival of Expedition 1 in November of 2000 The station is serviced by a variety of visiting spacecraft the Russian Soyuz and Progress the American Dragon and Cygnus the Japanese H II Transfer Vehicle and formerly the Space Shuttle and the European Automated Transfer Vehicle It has been visited by astronauts cosmonauts and space tourists from 17 different nations Space launch systems have been designed to reduce costs and improve dependability safety and reliability Most U S military and scientific satellites are launched into orbit by a family of expendable launch vehicles designed for a variety of missions Other nations have their own launch systems and there is strong competition in the commercial launch market to develop the next generation

       " 'The year 2021 will probably go down in the annals of space history as a turning point a moment when ordinary citizens started leaving Earth on a regular basis Multiple crews lifted off on several different spacecraft and for a brief moment this month there were a record 19 people in the weightless environment of space and eight of them were private citizens But for all the achievements of 2021 which include a rover landing on Mars a small drone called Ingenuity flying in that planet s thin atmosphere and the launch of the James Webb Space telescope the most powerful space telescope ever 2022 could hold just as much promise if not more If 2021 was the year of the private space tourist 2022 could be marked by the first steps toward a return to the moon as NASA and the growing space industry seek to maintain the momentum that has been building over the past several years in what has amounted to a renaissance of exploration A pair of massive rockets both more powerful than the Saturn V that flew the Apollo astronauts to the moon are getting ready to fly in 2022 Those launches would mark the first significant steps in NASA s Artemis program which aims to return astronauts to the lunar surface by 2025 and create a campaign that would allow a permanent presence on and around the moon After years of development and billions of dollars spent NASA is finally gearing up to launch its Space Launch System rocket and Orion crew capsule which are designed to return astronauts to the moon for the first time since Apollo The first mission known as Artemis I is scheduled for March or April and would send Orion without any crew on board to orbit around the moon If all goes well it would be followed by Artemis II in May 2024 which would again send Orion to orbit the moon but this time with astronauts on board NASA hopes a crew would be able to land on the moon by 2025 but that would depend on the success of previous flight tests and SpaceX s ability to get its Starship spacecraft up and running Over the past year Elon Musk s SpaceX has been moving feverishly toward the first orbital launch of Starship the vehicle that won a 3 billion NASA contract this year to rendezvous with the Orion and transport NASA s astronauts to the lunar surface Musk has said the company could attempt a launch in early 2022 Unlike the SLS which would ditch its massive booster stage into the ocean after launch Starship is designed to be fully reusable After putting the Starship spacecraft into orbit the Super Heavy booster would fly back to its launchpad where it would be caught by a pair of arms extended like chopsticks Earlier this year the company attempted suborbital hops where the spacecraft launched to an altitude of about six miles belly flopped back to Earth horizontally then righted itself and refired its engines before touching down Several of the landing attempts ended in fireballs But in May the company pulled off a successful landing fueling Musk s hope that the rocket could be used to transport people and cargo across the solar system The overarching goal of Starship is to be able to transport enough tonnage to the moon and Mars he said in an interview with The Washington Post earlier this year And to have a self sustaining base on the moon and ultimately a self sustaining city on Mars Ahead of an astronaut landing NASA is planning to send science missions to the lunar surface Those missions would also be carried out by contractors hired by the space agency to deliver science experiments and technology demonstrations that NASA says would help the agency study Earth s nearest neighbor and prepare for human landing missions The first would be by Intuitive Machines a Houston based company that is aiming to deliver science experiments in early 2022 and again later in the year That second mission to the south pole of the moon would have a drill that would probe the lunar regolith for ice Astrobotic based in Pittsburgh is also planning to deliver payloads to the lunar surface under the NASA contract Rocket Lab is also scheduled to launch a small satellite to the moon to serve as a precursor for human missions by testing the orbit for the space station known as Gateway that NASA hopes to send to the moon Rocket Lab which launches from its site in New Zealand hopes to have its first launch from the United States in 2022 from the pad it uses at NASA s facility on Wallops Island on Virginia s Eastern Shore It also plans to attempt to recover a booster next year But unlike SpaceX which flies the first stages of its rockets back to landing sites on the ground or ships at sea Rocket Lab intends to catch its relatively small booster under a parachute with a helicopter 2022 should also see the debut of a number of new rockets including the United Launch Alliance s Vulcan rocket which would be used by the Pentagon to launch national security satellites Relativity Space which uses a 3 D printer to manufacture its rockets plans to first launch of its Terran 1 vehicle from Cape Canaveral in the coming months as well Boeing also is looking to get back on track 2021 was supposed to be the year it finally completed a test flight of its Starliner spacecraft which is being designed to ferry NASA s astronauts to and from the International Space Station But once again it ran into trouble At the end of 2019 the spacecraft suffered software problems forcing the aviation behemoth to cut the test flight short The spacecraft finally returned to the launchpad this summer but never got off the ground This time the company said the issue was hardware 13 valves in the service module got stuck forcing the company to bring the spacecraft back into its manufacturing facility The company recently announced that it would have to swap out the service module It s now looking to attempt to launch again sometime in May If that goes well a launch with astronauts on board would follow The space station could see another new vehicle visit in 2022 Sierra Space s Dream Chaser a spaceplane that looks like a miniature version of the space shuttle The company has been developing the winged vehicle for years with the hopes of one day flying astronauts But for now it has a contract from NASA to use it to deliver cargo and supplies to the space station And it recently announced that it received a 1 4 billion investment that it said would help accelerate the program SpaceX s Dragon spacecraft which delivered two crews of astronauts to the space station in 2021 is slated to continue flying crews there in 2022 It also would fly at least one mission chartered by Axiom Space in which private astronauts who are paying 55 million apiece would spend a little more than a week on the station Jeff Bezos Blue Origin which flew three trips to the edge of space in 2021 plans to fly six or more suborbital flights in 2022 Bezos owns The Washington Post And Richard Branson s Virgin Galactic is hoping to complete its test campaign and start offering commercial service on its suborbital spaceplane for paying space tourists While those flights go just past the edge of space to a few dozen miles high NASA s scientists and engineers will be focused on a far more distant destination a million miles from Earth There the James Webb Space Telescope would begin to unfurl itself in delicate maneuvers after it was launched on Christmas Day on an Arianespace Ariane 5 rocket NASA says there are 344 potential single point failures and if anything goes wrong there is no way to send a repair crew But if it works the telescope would be able to capture light from more than 13 billion years ago as the beginning of the formation of the universe The telescope has been called an Apollo moment for science and could start answering some of astronomy s biggest questions about how the universe began The whole point of this is to see the unseen universe John M Grunsfeld former head of science at NASA

       " 'Astrobiology provides a compelling scientific rationale for space exploration In turn astrobiological data from other planets can often be obtained only by robotic explorers like the Mars rovers or from large space based telescopes that make observations of distant planets in our Solar System and beyond UWAB researchers work on specific engineering questions that enable space exploration such as propulsion and power systems and explore technologies for enabling manned missions to Mars Similarly many UWAB researchers work as team members or collaborators on ongoing spacecraft missions and space borne telescopes that study the Earth Mars and other planetary bodies UWAB researchers work in the areas of space propulsion space power systems energy conversion and laser applications Many of these new technologies have both Earth based and space based applications Work has also been done on developing technologies and architectures for manned and unmanned Mars missions based on in situ resource utilization including exploring the potential to extract water from the Martian atmosphere and crust for life support and the production of rocket fuel UW research into the detectability of signs of habitability and life on an Earth like planet has benefited strongly from UWAB faculty and student participation on the NASA EPOXI mission The EPOXI mission reused the Deep Impact spacecraft to take photometric and spectral observations of Earth from a distance allowing Earth to be studied as if it were an extrasolar planet Research led by UWAB students using EPOXI data has resulted in new techniques to detect extrasolar planetary oceans and the presence of moons orbiting extrasolar planets It has also provided constraints on the determination of surface temperature and pressure on extrasolar terrestrial planets UWAB s past and present scientific collaborations provide strong links to high profile spaceflight missions such as the Mars Exploration Rovers the Mars Phoenix Lander which studied the Martian near pole environment Mars Odyssey and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter which study temperature and mineralogy on Mars remotely from orbit the Mars Science Laboratory a new rover for the Martian surface that will search for signs of past life on Mars the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 which will map the sources and sinks of CO2 on the Earth and the Kepler mission a spaceborne telescope that is searching for Earth like planets around other stars Email astrobio uw edu Office Physics Astronomy Building Room B378',\n",
       " ' Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore outer space 1 While the exploration of space is carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes its physical exploration though is conducted both by uncrewed robotic space probes and human spaceflight Space exploration like its classical form astronomy is one of the main sources for space science While the observation of objects in space known as astronomy predates reliable recorded history it was the development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the mid twentieth century that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality The world s first large scale experimental rocket program was Opel RAK under the leadership of Fritz von Opel and Max Valier during the late 1920s leading to the first crewed rocket cars and rocket planes 2 3 which paved the way for the Nazi era V2 program and US and Soviet activities from 1950 onwards The Opel RAK program and the spectacular public demonstrations of ground and air vehicles drew large crowds as well as caused global public excitement as so called Rocket Rumble 4 and had a large long lasting impact on later spaceflight pioneers like Wernher von Braun Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research national prestige uniting different nations ensuring the future survival of humanity and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries 5 The early era of space exploration was driven by a Space Race between the Soviet Union and the United States The launch of the first human made object to orbit Earth the Soviet Union s Sputnik 1 on 4 October 1957 and the first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 mission on 20 July 1969 are often taken as landmarks for this initial period The Soviet space program achieved many of the first milestones including the first living being in orbit in 1957 the first human spaceflight Yuri Gagarin aboard Vostok 1 in 1961 the first spacewalk by Alexei Leonov on 18 March 1965 the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966 and the launch of the first space station Salyut 1 in 1971 After the first 20 years of exploration focus shifted from one off flights to renewable hardware such as the Space Shuttle program and from competition to cooperation as with the International Space Station ISS With the substantial completion of the ISS 6 following STS 133 in March 2011 plans for space exploration by the U S remain in flux Constellation a Bush Administration program for a return to the Moon by 2020 7 was judged inadequately funded and unrealistic by an expert review panel reporting in 2009 8 The Obama Administration proposed a revision of Constellation in 2010 to focus on the development of the capability for crewed missions beyond low Earth orbit LEO envisioning extending the operation of the ISS beyond 2020 transferring the development of launch vehicles for human crews from NASA to the private sector and developing technology to enable missions to beyond LEO such as Earth Moon L1 the Moon Earth Sun L2 near Earth asteroids and Phobos or Mars orbit 9 In the 2000s China initiated a successful crewed spaceflight program when India launched Chandraayan 1 while the European Union and Japan have also planned future crewed space missions China Russia and Japan have advocated crewed missions to the Moon during the 21st century while the European Union has advocated crewed missions to both the Moon and Mars during the 20th and 21st century From the 1990s onwards private interests began promoting space tourism and then public space exploration of the Moon see Google Lunar X Prize Students interested in Space have formed SEDS Students for the Exploration and Development of Space SpaceX is currently developing Starship a fully reusable orbital launch vehicle that is expected to massively reduce the cost of spaceflight and allow for crewed planetary exploration 10 11 The first telescope is said to have been invented in 1608 in the Netherlands by an eyeglass maker named Hans Lippershey The Orbiting Astronomical Observatory 2 was the first space telescope launched on 7 December 1968 12 As of 2 February 2019 there was 3 891 confirmed exoplanets discovered The Milky Way is estimated to contain 100 400 billion stars 13 and more than 100 billion planets 14 There are at least 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe 15 16 GN z11 is the most distant known object from Earth reported as 32 billion light years away 17 18 In 1949 the Bumper WAC reached an altitude of 393 kilometres 244 mi becoming the first human made object to enter space according to NASA 19 although V 2 Rocket MW 18014 crossed the Kármán line earlier in 1944 20 The first successful orbital launch was of the Soviet uncrewed Sputnik 1 Satellite 1 mission on 4 October 1957 The satellite weighed about 83 kg 183 lb and is believed to have orbited Earth at a height of about 250 km 160 mi It had two radio transmitters 20 and 40 MHz which emitted beeps that could be heard by radios around the globe Analysis of the radio signals was used to gather information about the electron density of the ionosphere while temperature and pressure data was encoded in the duration of radio beeps The results indicated that the satellite was not punctured by a meteoroid Sputnik 1 was launched by an R 7 rocket It burned up upon re entry on 3 January 1958 The first successful human spaceflight was Vostok 1 East 1 carrying the 27 year old Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin on 12 April 1961 The spacecraft completed one orbit around the globe lasting about 1 hour and 48 minutes Gagarin s flight resonated around the world it was a demonstration of the advanced Soviet space program and it opened an entirely new era in space exploration human spaceflight The first artificial object to reach another celestial body was Luna 2 reaching the Moon in 1959 21 The first soft landing on another celestial body was performed by Luna 9 landing on the Moon on 3 February 1966 22 Luna 10 became the first artificial satellite of the Moon entering in a lunar orbit on 3 April 1966 23 The first crewed landing on another celestial body was performed by Apollo 11 on 20 July 1969 landing on the Moon There have been a total of six spacecraft with humans landing on the Moon starting from 1969 to the last human landing in 1972 The first interplanetary flyby was the 1961 Venera 1 flyby of Venus though the 1962 Mariner 2 was the first flyby of Venus to return data closest approach 34 773 kilometers Pioneer 6 was the first satellite to orbit the Sun launched on 16 December 1965 The other planets were first flown by in 1965 for Mars by Mariner 4 1973 for Jupiter by Pioneer 10 1974 for Mercury by Mariner 10 1979 for Saturn by Pioneer 11 1986 for Uranus by Voyager 2 1989 for Neptune by Voyager 2 In 2015 the dwarf planets Ceres and Pluto were orbited by Dawn and passed by New Horizons respectively This accounts for flybys of each of the eight planets in the Solar System the Sun the Moon and Ceres Pluto 2 of the 5 recognized dwarf planets The first interplanetary surface mission to return at least limited surface data from another planet was the 1970 landing of Venera 7 which returned data to Earth for 23 minutes from Venus In 1975 the Venera 9 was the first to return images from the surface of another planet returning images from Venus In 1971 the Mars 3 mission achieved the first soft landing on Mars returning data for almost 20 seconds Later much longer duration surface missions were achieved including over six years of Mars surface operation by Viking 1 from 1975 to 1982 and over two hours of transmission from the surface of Venus by Venera 13 in 1982 the longest ever Soviet planetary surface mission Venus and Mars are the two planets outside of Earth on which humans have conducted surface missions with uncrewed robotic spacecraft Salyut 1 was the first space station of any kind launched into low Earth orbit by the Soviet Union on 19 April 1971 The International Space Station is currently the only fully functional space station inhabited continuously since the year 2000 Voyager 1 became the first human made object to leave the Solar System into interstellar space on 25 August 2012 The probe passed the heliopause at 121 AU to enter interstellar space 24 The Apollo 13 flight passed the far side of the Moon at an altitude of 254 kilometers 158 miles 137 nautical miles above the lunar surface and 400 171 km 248 655 mi from Earth marking the record for the farthest humans have ever traveled from Earth in 1970 Voyager 1 is currently at a distance of 145 11 astronomical units 2 1708 1010 km 1 3489 1010 mi 21 708 billion kilometers 13 489 billion miles from Earth as of 1 January 2019 25 It is the most distant human made object from Earth 26 GN z11 is the most distant known object from Earth reported as 13 4 billion light years away 17 18 The dream of stepping into the outer reaches of Earth s atmosphere was driven by the fiction of Jules Verne 27 28 29 and H G Wells 30 and rocket technology was developed to try to realize this vision The German V 2 was the first rocket to travel into space overcoming the problems of thrust and material failure During the final days of World War II this technology was obtained by both the Americans and Soviets as were its designers The initial driving force for further development of the technology was a weapons race for intercontinental ballistic missiles ICBMs to be used as long range carriers for fast nuclear weapon delivery but in 1961 when the Soviet Union launched the first man into space the United States declared itself to be in a Space Race with the Soviets Konstantin Tsiolkovsky Robert Goddard Hermann Oberth and Reinhold Tiling laid the groundwork of rocketry in the early years of the 20th century Wernher von Braun was the lead rocket engineer for Nazi Germany s World War II V 2 rocket project In the last days of the war he led a caravan of workers in the German rocket program to the American lines where they surrendered and were brought to the United States to work on their rocket development Operation Paperclip He acquired American citizenship and led the team that developed and launched Explorer 1 the first American satellite Von Braun later led the team at NASA s Marshall Space Flight Center which developed the Saturn V moon rocket Initially the race for space was often led by Sergei Korolev whose legacy includes both the R7 and Soyuz which remain in service to this day Korolev was the mastermind behind the first satellite first man and first woman in orbit and first spacewalk Until his death his identity was a closely guarded state secret not even his mother knew that he was responsible for creating the Soviet space program Kerim Kerimov was one of the founders of the Soviet space program and was one of the lead architects behind the first human spaceflight Vostok 1 alongside Sergey Korolev After Korolev s death in 1966 Kerimov became the lead scientist of the Soviet space program and was responsible for the launch of the first space stations from 1971 to 1991 including the Salyut and Mir series and their precursors in 1967 the Cosmos 186 and Cosmos 188 31 32 Other key people Starting in the mid 20th century probes and then human mission were sent into Earth orbit and then on to the Moon Also probes were sent throughout the known Solar system and into Solar orbit Uncrewed spacecraft have been sent into orbit around Saturn Jupiter Mars Venus and Mercury by the 21st century and the most distance active spacecraft Voyager 1 and 2 traveled beyond 100 times the Earth Sun distance The instruments were enough though that it is thought they have left the Sun s heliosphere a sort of bubble of particles made in the Galaxy by the Sun s solar wind The Sun is a major focus of space exploration Being above the atmosphere in particular and Earth s magnetic field gives access to the solar wind and infrared and ultraviolet radiations that cannot reach Earth s surface The Sun generates most space weather which can affect power generation and transmission systems on Earth and interfere with and even damage satellites and space probes Numerous spacecraft dedicated to observing the Sun beginning with the Apollo Telescope Mount have been launched and still others have had solar observation as a secondary objective Parker Solar Probe launched in 2018 will approach the Sun to within 1 8th the orbit of Mercury Mercury remains the least explored of the Terrestrial planets As of May 2013 the Mariner 10 and MESSENGER missions have been the only missions that have made close observations of Mercury MESSENGER entered orbit around Mercury in March 2011 to further investigate the observations made by Mariner 10 in 1975 Munsell 2006b A third mission to Mercury scheduled to arrive in 2025 BepiColombo is to include two probes BepiColombo is a joint mission between Japan and the European Space Agency MESSENGER and BepiColombo are intended to gather complementary data to help scientists understand many of the mysteries discovered by Mariner 10 s flybys Flights to other planets within the Solar System are accomplished at a cost in energy which is described by the net change in velocity of the spacecraft or delta v Due to the relatively high delta v to reach Mercury and its proximity to the Sun it is difficult to explore and orbits around it are rather unstable Venus was the first target of interplanetary flyby and lander missions and despite one of the most hostile surface environments in the Solar System has had more landers sent to it nearly all from the Soviet Union than any other planet in the Solar System The first flyby was the 1961 Venera 1 though the 1962 Mariner 2 was the first flyby to successfully return data Mariner 2 has been followed by several other flybys by multiple space agencies often as part of missions using a Venus flyby to provide a gravitational assist en route to other celestial bodies In 1967 Venera 4 became the first probe to enter and directly examine the atmosphere of Venus In 1970 Venera 7 became the first successful lander to reach the surface of Venus and by 1985 it had been followed by eight additional successful Soviet Venus landers which provided images and other direct surface data Starting in 1975 with the Soviet orbiter Venera 9 some ten successful orbiter missions have been sent to Venus including later missions which were able to map the surface of Venus using radar to pierce the obscuring atmosphere Space exploration has been used as a tool to understand Earth as a celestial object in its own right Orbital missions can provide data for Earth that can be difficult or impossible to obtain from a purely ground based point of reference For example the existence of the Van Allen radiation belts was unknown until their discovery by the United States first artificial satellite Explorer 1 These belts contain radiation trapped by Earth s magnetic fields which currently renders construction of habitable space stations above 1000 km impractical Following this early unexpected discovery a large number of Earth observation satellites have been deployed specifically to explore Earth from a space based perspective These satellites have significantly contributed to the understanding of a variety of Earth based phenomena For instance the hole in the ozone layer was found by an artificial satellite that was exploring Earth s atmosphere and satellites have allowed for the discovery of archeological sites or geological formations that were difficult or impossible to otherwise identify The Moon was the first celestial body to be the object of space exploration It holds the distinctions of being the first remote celestial object to be flown by orbited and landed upon by spacecraft and the only remote celestial object ever to be visited by humans In 1959 the Soviets obtained the first images of the far side of the Moon never previously visible to humans The U S exploration of the Moon began with the Ranger 4 impactor in 1962 Starting in 1966 the Soviets successfully deployed a number of landers to the Moon which were able to obtain data directly from the Moon s surface just four months later Surveyor 1 marked the debut of a successful series of U S landers The Soviet uncrewed missions culminated in the Lunokhod program in the early 1970s which included the first uncrewed rovers and also successfully brought lunar soil samples to Earth for study This marked the first and to date the only automated return of extraterrestrial soil samples to Earth Uncrewed exploration of the Moon continues with various nations periodically deploying lunar orbiters and in 2008 the Indian Moon Impact Probe Crewed exploration of the Moon began in 1968 with the Apollo 8 mission that successfully orbited the Moon the first time any extraterrestrial object was orbited by humans In 1969 the Apollo 11 mission marked the first time humans set foot upon another world Crewed exploration of the Moon did not continue for long The Apollo 17 mission in 1972 marked the sixth landing and the most recent human visit Artemis 2 will flyby the Moon in 2022 Robotic missions are still pursued vigorously The exploration of Mars has been an important part of the space exploration programs of the Soviet Union later Russia the United States Europe Japan and India Dozens of robotic spacecraft including orbiters landers and rovers have been launched toward Mars since the 1960s These missions were aimed at gathering data about current conditions and answering questions about the history of Mars The questions raised by the scientific community are expected to not only give a better appreciation of the red planet but also yield further insight into the past and possible future of Earth Mars is the prime candidate where humans could live outside the Earth and the technology to reach Mars is possible 33 The exploration of Mars has come at a considerable financial cost with roughly two thirds of all spacecraft destined for Mars failing before completing their missions with some failing before they even began Such a high failure rate can be attributed to the complexity and large number of variables involved in an interplanetary journey and has led researchers to jokingly speak of The Great Galactic Ghoul 34 which subsists on a diet of Mars probes This phenomenon is also informally known as the Mars Curse 35 In contrast to overall high failure rates in the exploration of Mars India has become the first country to achieve success of its maiden attempt India s Mars Orbiter Mission MOM 36 37 38 is one of the least expensive interplanetary missions ever undertaken with an approximate total cost of 450 Crore US 73 million 39 40 The first mission to Mars by any Arab country has been taken up by the United Arab Emirates Called the Emirates Mars Mission it is scheduled for launch in 2020 The uncrewed exploratory probe has been named Hope Probe and will be sent to Mars to study its atmosphere in detail 41 The Russian space mission Fobos Grunt which launched on 9 November 2011 experienced a failure leaving it stranded in low Earth orbit 42 It was to begin exploration of the Phobos and Martian circumterrestrial orbit and study whether the moons of Mars or at least Phobos could be a trans shipment point for spaceships traveling to Mars 43 Until the advent of space travel objects in the asteroid belt were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes their shapes and terrain remaining a mystery Several asteroids have now been visited by probes the first of which was Galileo which flew past two 951 Gaspra in 1991 followed by 243 Ida in 1993 Both of these lay near enough to Galileo s planned trajectory to Jupiter that they could be visited at acceptable cost The first landing on an asteroid was performed by the NEAR Shoemaker probe in 2000 following an orbital survey of the object The dwarf planet Ceres and the asteroid 4 Vesta two of the three largest asteroids were visited by NASA s Dawn spacecraft launched in 2007 Hayabusa was a robotic spacecraft developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency to return a sample of material from the small near Earth asteroid 25143 Itokawa to Earth for further analysis Hayabusa was launched on 9 May 2003 and rendezvoused with Itokawa in mid September 2005 After arriving at Itokawa Hayabusa studied the asteroid s shape spin topography color composition density and history In November 2005 it landed on the asteroid twice to collect samples The spacecraft returned to Earth on 13 June 2010 The exploration of Jupiter has consisted solely of a number of automated NASA spacecraft visiting the planet since 1973 A large majority of the missions have been flybys in which detailed observations are taken without the probe landing or entering orbit such as in Pioneer and Voyager programs The Galileo and Juno spacecraft are the only spacecraft to have entered the planet s orbit As Jupiter is believed to have only a relatively small rocky core and no real solid surface a landing mission is precluded Reaching Jupiter from Earth requires a delta v of 9 2 km s 44 which is comparable to the 9 7 km s delta v needed to reach low Earth orbit 45 Fortunately gravity assists through planetary flybys can be used to reduce the energy required at launch to reach Jupiter albeit at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration 44 Jupiter has 80 known moons many of which have relatively little known information about them Saturn has been explored only through uncrewed spacecraft launched by NASA including one mission Cassini Huygens planned and executed in cooperation with other space agencies These missions consist of flybys in 1979 by Pioneer 11 in 1980 by Voyager 1 in 1982 by Voyager 2 and an orbital mission by the Cassini spacecraft which lasted from 2004 until 2017 Saturn has at least 62 known moons although the exact number is debatable since Saturn s rings are made up of vast numbers of independently orbiting objects of varying sizes The largest of the moons is Titan which holds the distinction of being the only moon in the Solar System with an atmosphere denser and thicker than that of Earth Titan holds the distinction of being the only object in the Outer Solar System that has been explored with a lander the Huygens probe deployed by the Cassini spacecraft The exploration of Uranus has been entirely through the Voyager 2 spacecraft with no other visits currently planned Given its axial tilt of 97 77 with its polar regions exposed to sunlight or darkness for long periods scientists were not sure what to expect at Uranus The closest approach to Uranus occurred on 24 January 1986 Voyager 2 studied the planet s unique atmosphere and magnetosphere Voyager 2 also examined its ring system and the moons of Uranus including all five of the previously known moons while discovering an additional ten previously unknown moons Images of Uranus proved to have a very uniform appearance with no evidence of the dramatic storms or atmospheric banding evident on Jupiter and Saturn Great effort was required to even identify a few clouds in the images of the planet The magnetosphere of Uranus however proved to be unique being profoundly affected by the planet s unusual axial tilt In contrast to the bland appearance of Uranus itself striking images were obtained of the Moons of Uranus including evidence that Miranda had been unusually geologically active The exploration of Neptune began with 25 August 1989 Voyager 2 flyby the sole visit to the system as of 2014 The possibility of a Neptune Orbiter has been discussed but no other missions have been given serious thought Although the extremely uniform appearance of Uranus during Voyager 2 s visit in 1986 had led to expectations that Neptune would also have few visible atmospheric phenomena the spacecraft found that Neptune had obvious banding visible clouds auroras and even a conspicuous anticyclone storm system rivaled in size only by Jupiter s Great Red Spot Neptune also proved to have the fastest winds of any planet in the Solar System measured as high as 2 100 km h 46 Voyager 2 also examined Neptune s ring and moon system It discovered 900 complete rings and additional partial ring arcs around Neptune In addition to examining Neptune s three previously known moons Voyager 2 also discovered five previously unknown moons one of which Proteus proved to be the last largest moon in the system Data from Voyager 2 supported the view that Neptune s largest moon Triton is a captured Kuiper belt object 47 The dwarf planet Pluto presents significant challenges for spacecraft because of its great distance from Earth requiring high velocity for reasonable trip times and small mass making capture into orbit very difficult at present Voyager 1 could have visited Pluto but controllers opted instead for a close flyby of Saturn s moon Titan resulting in a trajectory incompatible with a Pluto flyby Voyager 2 never had a plausible trajectory for reaching Pluto 48 After an intense political battle a mission to Pluto dubbed New Horizons was granted funding from the United States government in 2003 49 New Horizons was launched successfully on 19 January 2006 In early 2007 the craft made use of a gravity assist from Jupiter Its closest approach to Pluto was on 14 July 2015 scientific observations of Pluto began five months prior to closest approach and continued for 16 days after the encounter The New Horizons mission did a flyby of the small planetesimal Arrokoth in 2019 Although many comets have been studied from Earth sometimes with centuries worth of observations only a few comets have been closely visited In 1985 the International Cometary Explorer conducted the first comet fly by 21P Giacobini Zinner before joining the Halley Armada studying the famous comet The Deep Impact probe smashed into 9P Tempel to learn more about its structure and composition and the Stardust mission returned samples of another comet s tail The Philae lander successfully landed on Comet Churyumov Gerasimenko in 2014 as part of the broader Rosetta mission Deep space exploration is the branch of astronomy astronautics and space technology that is involved with the exploration of distant regions of outer space 50 Physical exploration of space is conducted both by human spaceflights deep space astronautics and by robotic spacecraft Some of the best candidates for future deep space engine technologies include anti matter nuclear power and beamed propulsion 51 The latter beamed propulsion appears to be the best candidate for deep space exploration presently available since it uses known physics and known technology that is being developed for other purposes 52 Breakthrough Starshot is a research and engineering project by the Breakthrough Initiatives to develop a proof of concept fleet of light sail spacecraft named StarChip 53 to be capable of making the journey to the Alpha Centauri star system 4 37 light years away It was founded in 2016 by Yuri Milner Stephen Hawking and Mark Zuckerberg 54 55 An article in science magazine Nature suggested the use of asteroids as a gateway for space exploration with the ultimate destination being Mars In order to make such an approach viable three requirements need to be fulfilled first a thorough asteroid survey to find thousands of nearby bodies suitable for astronauts to visit second extending flight duration and distance capability to ever increasing ranges out to Mars and finally developing better robotic vehicles and tools to enable astronauts to explore an asteroid regardless of its size shape or spin Furthermore using asteroids would provide astronauts with protection from galactic cosmic rays with mission crews being able to land on them without great risk to radiation exposure The James Webb Space Telescope JWST or Webb is a space telescope that is planned to be the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope 56 57 The JWST will provide greatly improved resolution and sensitivity over the Hubble and will enable a broad range of investigations across the fields of astronomy and cosmology including observing some of the most distant events and objects in the universe such as the formation of the first galaxies Other goals include understanding the formation of stars and planets and direct imaging of exoplanets and novas 58 The primary mirror of the JWST the Optical Telescope Element is composed of 18 hexagonal mirror segments made of gold plated beryllium which combine to create a 6 5 meter 21 ft 260 in diameter mirror that is much larger than the Hubble s 2 4 meter 7 9 ft 94 in mirror Unlike the Hubble which observes in the near ultraviolet visible and near infrared 0 1 to 1 μm spectra the JWST will observe in a lower frequency range from long wavelength visible light through mid infrared 0 6 to 27 μm which will allow it to observe high redshift objects that are too old and too distant for the Hubble to observe 59 The telescope must be kept very cold in order to observe in the infrared without interference so it will be deployed in space near the Earth Sun L2 Lagrangian point and a large sunshield made of silicon and aluminum coated Kapton will keep its mirror and instruments below 50 K 220 C 370 F 60 The Artemis program is an ongoing crewed spaceflight program carried out by NASA U S commercial spaceflight companies and international partners such as ESA 61 with the goal of landing the first woman and the next man on the Moon specifically at the lunar south pole region by 2024 Artemis would be the next step towards the long term goal of establishing a sustainable presence on the Moon laying the foundation for private companies to build a lunar economy and eventually sending humans to Mars In 2017 the lunar campaign was authorized by Space Policy Directive 1 utilizing various ongoing spacecraft programs such as Orion the Lunar Gateway Commercial Lunar Payload Services and adding an undeveloped crewed lander The Space Launch System will serve as the primary launch vehicle for Orion while commercial launch vehicles are planned for use to launch various other elements of the campaign 62 NASA requested 1 6 billion in additional funding for Artemis for fiscal year 2020 63 while the Senate Appropriations Committee requested from NASA a five year budget profile 64 which is needed for evaluation and approval by Congress 65 66 The research that is conducted by national space exploration agencies such as NASA and Roscosmos is one of the reasons supporters cite to justify government expenses Economic analyses of the NASA programs often showed ongoing economic benefits such as NASA spin offs generating many times the revenue of the cost of the program 67 It is also argued that space exploration would lead to the extraction of resources on other planets and especially asteroids which contain billions of dollars that worth of minerals and metals Such expeditions could generate a lot of revenue 68 In addition it has been argued that space exploration programs help inspire youth to study in science and engineering 69 Space exploration also gives scientists the ability to perform experiments in other settings and expand humanity s knowledge 70 Another claim is that space exploration is a necessity to mankind and that staying on Earth will lead to extinction Some of the reasons are lack of natural resources comets nuclear war and worldwide epidemic Stephen Hawking renowned British theoretical physicist said that I don t think the human race will survive the next thousand years unless we spread into space There are too many accidents that can befall life on a single planet But I m an optimist We will reach out to the stars 71 Arthur C Clarke 1950 presented a summary of motivations for the human exploration of space in his non fiction semi technical monograph Interplanetary Flight 72 He argued that humanity s choice is essentially between expansion off Earth into space versus cultural and eventually biological stagnation and death These motivations could be attributed to one of the first rocket scientists in NASA Wernher von Braun and his vision of humans moving beyond Earth The basis of this plan was to Develop multi stage rockets capable of placing satellites animals and humans in space Development of large winged reusable spacecraft capable of carrying humans and equipment into Earth orbit in a way that made space access routine and cost effective Construction of a large permanently occupied space station to be used as a platform both to observe Earth and from which to launch deep space expeditions Launching the first human flights around the Moon leading to the first landings of humans on the Moon with the intent of exploring that body and establishing permanent lunar bases Assembly and fueling of spaceships in Earth orbit for the purpose of sending humans to Mars with the intent of eventually colonizing that planet 73 Known as the Von Braun Paradigm the plan was formulated to lead humans in the exploration of space Von Braun s vision of human space exploration served as the model for efforts in space space exploration well into the twenty first century with NASA incorporating this approach into the majority of their projects 73 The steps were followed out of order as seen by the Apollo program reaching the moon before the space shuttle program was started which in turn was used to complete the International Space Station Von Braun s Paradigm formed NASA s drive for human exploration in the hopes that humans discover the far reaches of the universe NASA has produced a series of public service announcement videos supporting the concept of space exploration 74 Overall the public remains largely supportive of both crewed and uncrewed space exploration According to an Associated Press Poll conducted in July 2003 71 of U S citizens agreed with the statement that the space program is a good investment compared to 21 who did not 75 Space advocacy and space policy 76 regularly invokes exploration as a human nature 77 This advocacy has been criticized by scholars as essentializing and continuation of colonialism 78 79 80 81 particularly manifest destiny making space exploration misaligned with science and a less inclusive field 76 Spaceflight is the use of space technology to achieve the flight of spacecraft into and through outer space Spaceflight is used in space exploration and also in commercial activities like space tourism and satellite telecommunications Additional non commercial uses of spaceflight include space observatories reconnaissance satellites and other Earth observation satellites A spaceflight typically begins with a rocket launch which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of gravity and propels the spacecraft from the surface of Earth Once in space the motion of a spacecraft both when unpropelled and when under propulsion is covered by the area of study called astrodynamics Some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely some disintegrate during atmospheric reentry and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact Satellites are used for a large number of purposes Common types include military spy and civilian Earth observation satellites communication satellites navigation satellites weather satellites and research satellites Space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites The commercialization of space first started out with the launching of private satellites by NASA or other space agencies Current examples of the commercial satellite use of space include satellite navigation systems satellite television and satellite radio The next step of commercialization of space was seen as human spaceflight Flying humans safely to and from space had become routine to NASA 82 Reusable spacecraft were an entirely new engineering challenge something only seen in novels and films like Star Trek and War of the Worlds Great names like Buzz Aldrin supported the use of making a reusable vehicle like the space shuttle Aldrin held that reusable spacecraft were the key in making space travel affordable stating that the use of passenger space travel is a huge potential market big enough to justify the creation of reusable launch vehicles 83 How can the public go against the words of one of America s best known heroes in space exploration After all exploring space is the next great expedition following the example of Lewis and Clark Space tourism is the next step reusable vehicles in the commercialization of space The purpose of this form of space travel is used by individuals for the purpose of personal pleasure Private spaceflight companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin and commercial space stations such as the Axiom Space and the Bigelow Commercial Space Station have dramatically changed the landscape of space exploration and will continue to do so in the near future Astrobiology is the interdisciplinary study of life in the universe combining aspects of astronomy biology and geology 84 It is focused primarily on the study of the origin distribution and evolution of life It is also known as exobiology from Greek έξω exo outside 85 86 87 The term Xenobiology has been used as well but this is technically incorrect because its terminology means biology of the foreigners 88 Astrobiologists must also consider the possibility of life that is chemically entirely distinct from any life found on Earth 89 In the Solar System some of the prime locations for current or past astrobiology are on Enceladus Europa Mars and Titan 90 To date the longest human occupation of space is the International Space Station which has been in continuous use for 21 years 107 days Valeri Polyakov s record single spaceflight of almost 438 days aboard the Mir space station has not been surpassed The health effects of space have been well documented through years of research conducted in the field of aerospace medicine Analog environments similar to those one may experience in space travel like deep sea submarines have been used in this research to further explore the relationship between isolation and extreme environments 91 It is imperative that the health of the crew be maintained as any deviation from baseline may compromise the integrity of the mission as well as the safety of the crew hence the reason why astronauts must endure rigorous medical screenings and tests prior to embarking on any missions However it does not take long for the environmental dynamics of spaceflight to commence its toll on the human body for example space motion sickness SMS a condition which affects the neurovestibular system and culminates in mild to severe signs and symptoms such as vertigo dizziness fatigue nausea and disorientation plagues almost all space travelers within their first few days in orbit 91 Space travel can also have a profound impact on the psyche of the crew members as delineated in anecdotal writings composed after their retirement Space travel can adversely affect the body s natural biological clock circadian rhythm sleep patterns causing sleep deprivation and fatigue and social interaction consequently residing in a Low Earth Orbit LEO environment for a prolonged amount of time can result in both mental and physical exhaustion 91 Long term stays in space reveal issues with bone and muscle loss in low gravity immune system suppression and radiation exposure The lack of gravity causes fluid to rise upward which can cause pressure to build up in the eye resulting in vision problems the loss of bone minerals and densities cardiovascular deconditioning and decreased endurance and muscle mass 92 Radiation is perhaps the most insidious health hazard to space travelers as it is invisible to the naked eye and can cause cancer Space craft are no longer protected from the sun s radiation as they are positioned above the Earth s magnetic field the danger of radiation is even more potent when one enters deep space The hazards of radiation can be ameliorated through protective shielding on the spacecraft alerts and dosimetry 93 Fortunately with new and rapidly evolving technological advancements those in Mission Control are able to monitor the health of their astronauts more closely utilizing telemedicine One may not be able to completely evade the physiological effects of space flight but they can be mitigated For example medical systems aboard space vessels such as the International Space Station ISS are well equipped and designed to counteract the effects of lack of gravity and weightlessness on board treadmills can help prevent muscle loss and reduce the risk of developing premature osteoporosis 91 93 Additionally a crew medical officer is appointed for each ISS mission and a flight surgeon is available 24 7 via the ISS Mission Control Center located in Houston Texas 94 Although the interactions are intended to take place in real time communications between the space and terrestrial crew may become delayed sometimes by as much as 20 minutes 93 as their distance from each other increases when the spacecraft moves further out of LEO because of this the crew are trained and need to be prepared to respond to any medical emergencies that may arise on the vessel as the ground crew are hundreds of miles away As one can see travelling and possibly living in space poses many challenges Many past and current concepts for the continued exploration and colonization of space focus on a return to the Moon as a stepping stone to the other planets especially Mars At the end of 2006 NASA announced they were planning to build a permanent Moon base with continual presence by 2024 95 Beyond the technical factors that could make living in space more widespread it has been suggested that the lack of private property the inability or difficulty in establishing property rights in space has been an impediment to the development of space for human habitation Since the advent of space technology in the latter half of the twentieth century the ownership of property in space has been murky with strong arguments both for and against In particular the making of national territorial claims in outer space and on celestial bodies has been specifically proscribed by the Outer Space Treaty which had been as of 2012 update ratified by all spacefaring nations 96 Space colonization also called space settlement and space humanization would be the permanent autonomous self sufficient human habitation of locations outside Earth especially of natural satellites or planets such as the Moon or Mars using significant amounts of in situ resource utilization Participation and representation of humanity in space is an issue ever since the first phase of space exploration 81 Some rights of non spacefaring countries have been secured through international space law declaring space the province of all mankind understanding spaceflight as its resource though sharing of space for all humanity is still criticized as imperialist and lacking 81 Additionally to international inclusion the inclusion of women and people of colour has also been lacking To reach a more inclusive spaceflight some organizations like the Justspace Alliance 81 and IAU featured Inclusive Astronomy 97 have been formed in recent years The first woman to ever enter space was Valentina Tereshkova She flew in 1963 but it was not until the 1980s that another woman entered space again All astronauts were required to be military test pilots at the time and women were not able to enter this career this is one reason for the delay in allowing women to join space crews citation needed After the rule changed Svetlana Savitskaya became the second woman to enter space she was also from the Soviet Union Sally Ride became the next woman to enter space and the first woman to enter space through the United States program Since then eleven other countries have allowed women astronauts The first all female space walk occurred in 2018 including Christina Koch and Jessica Meir These two women have both participated in separate space walks with NASA The first woman to go to the moon is planned for 2024 Despite these developments women are still underrepresented among astronauts and especially cosmonauts Issues that block potential applicants from the programs and limit the space missions they are able to go on are for example Additionally women have been discriminately treated for example as with Sally Ride by being scrutinized more than her male counterparts and asked sexist questions by the press citation needed Artistry in and from space ranges from signals capturing and arranging material like Yuri Gagarin s selfie in space or the image The Blue Marble over drawings like the first one in space by cosmonaut and artist Alexei Leonov music videos like Chris Hadfield s cover of Space Oddity on board the ISS to permanent installations on celestial bodies like on the Moon Solar

universe beyond Earth s atmosphere and the use of the information so gained to increase knowledge of the cosmos and benefit humanity A complete list of all crewed spaceflights with details on each mission s accomplishments and crew is available in the section Chronology of crewed spaceflights Humans have always looked at the heavens and wondered about the nature of the objects seen in the night sky With the development of rockets and the advances in electronics and other technologies in the 20th century it became possible to send machines and animals and then people above Earth s atmosphere into outer space Well before technology made these achievements possible however space exploration had already captured the minds of many people not only aircraft pilots and scientists but also writers and artists The strong hold that space travel has always had on the imagination may well explain why professional astronauts and laypeople alike consent at their great peril in the words of Tom Wolfe in The Right Stuff 1979 to sit on top of an enormous Roman candle such as a Redstone Atlas Titan or Saturn rocket and wait for someone to light the fuse It perhaps also explains why space exploration has been a common and enduring theme in literature and art As centuries of speculative fiction in books and more recently in films make clear one small step for a man one giant leap for mankind was taken by the human spirit many times and in many ways before Neil Armstrong stamped humankind s first footprint on the Moon Achieving spaceflight enabled humans to begin to explore the solar system and the rest of the universe to understand the many objects and phenomena that are better observed from a space perspective and to use for human benefit the resources and attributes of the space environment All of these activities discovery scientific understanding and the application of that understanding to serve human purposes are elements of space exploration For a general discussion of spacecraft launch considerations flight trajectories and navigation docking and recovery procedures see spaceflight Although the possibility of exploring space has long excited people in many walks of life for most of the latter 20th century and into the early 21st century only national governments could afford the very high costs of launching people and machines into space This reality meant that space exploration had to serve very broad interests and it indeed has done so in a variety of ways Government space programs have increased knowledge served as indicators of national prestige and power enhanced national security and military strength and provided significant benefits to the general public In areas where the private sector could profit from activities in space most notably the use of satellites as telecommunication relays commercial space activity has flourished without government funding In the early 21st century entrepreneurs believed that there were several other areas of commercial potential in space most notably privately funded space travel In the years after World War II governments assumed a leading role in the support of research that increased fundamental knowledge about nature a role that earlier had been played by universities private foundations and other nongovernmental supporters This change came for two reasons First the need for complex equipment to carry out many scientific experiments and for the large teams of researchers to use that equipment led to costs that only governments could afford Second governments were willing to take on this responsibility because of the belief that fundamental research would produce new knowledge essential to the health the security and the quality of life of their citizens Thus when scientists sought government support for early space experiments it was forthcoming Since the start of space efforts in the United States the Soviet Union and Europe national governments have given high priority to the support of science done in and from space From modest beginnings space science has expanded under government support to include multibillion dollar exploratory missions in the solar system Examples of such efforts include the development of the Curiosity Mars rover the Cassini Huygens mission to Saturn and its moons and the development of major space based astronomical observatories such as the Hubble Space Telescope Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in 1957 used the fact that his country had been first to launch a satellite as evidence of the technological power of the Soviet Union and of the superiority of communism He repeated these claims after Yuri Gagarin s orbital flight in 1961 Although U S Pres Dwight D Eisenhower had decided not to compete for prestige with the Soviet Union in a space race his successor John F Kennedy had a different view On April 20 1961 in the aftermath of the Gagarin flight he asked his advisers to identify a space program which promises dramatic results in which we could win The response came in a May 8 1961 memorandum recommending that the United States commit to sending people to the Moon because dramatic achievements in space symbolize the technological power and organizing capacity of a nation and because the ensuing prestige would be part of the battle along the fluid front of the cold war From 1961 until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 competition between the United States and the Soviet Union was a major influence on the pace and content of their space programs Other countries also viewed having a successful space program as an important indicator of national strength Even before the first satellite was launched U S leaders recognized that the ability to observe military activities around the world from space would be an asset to national security Following on the success of its photoreconnaissance satellites which began operation in 1960 the United States built increasingly complex observation and electronic intercept intelligence satellites The Soviet Union also quickly developed an array of intelligence satellites and later a few other countries instituted their own satellite observation programs Intelligence gathering satellites have been used to verify arms control agreements provide warnings of military threats and identify targets during military operations among other uses In addition to providing security benefits satellites offered military forces the potential for improved communications weather observation navigation timing and position location This led to significant government funding for military space programs in the United States and the Soviet Union Although the advantages and disadvantages of stationing force delivery weapons in space have been debated as of the early 21st century such weapons had not been deployed nor had space based antisatellite systems that is systems that can attack or interfere with orbiting satellites The stationing of weapons of mass destruction in orbit or on celestial bodies is prohibited by international law Governments realized early on that the ability to observe Earth from space could provide significant benefits to the general public apart from security and military uses The first application to be pursued was the development of satellites for assisting in weather forecasting A second application involved remote observation of land and sea surfaces to gather imagery and other data of value in crop forecasting resource management environmental monitoring and other applications The U S the Soviet Union Europe and China also developed their own satellite based global positioning systems originally for military purposes that could pinpoint a user s exact location help in navigating from one point to another and provide very precise time signals These satellites quickly found numerous civilian uses in such areas as personal navigation surveying and cartography geology air traffic control and the operation of information transfer networks They illustrate a reality that has remained constant for a half century as space capabilities are developed they often can be used for both military and civilian purposes Another space application that began under government sponsorship but quickly moved into the private sector is the relay of voice video and data via orbiting satellites Satellite telecommunications has developed into a multibillion dollar business and is the one clearly successful area of commercial space activity A related but economically much smaller commercial space business is the provision of launches for private and government satellites In 2004 a privately financed venture sent a piloted spacecraft SpaceShipOne to the lower edge of space for three brief suborbital flights Although it was technically a much less challenging achievement than carrying humans into orbit its success was seen as an important step toward opening up space to commercial travel and eventually to tourism More than 15 years after SpaceShipOne reached space several firms began to carry out such suborbital flights Companies have arisen that also use satellite imagery to provide data for business about economic trends Suggestions have been made that in the future other areas of space activity including using resources found on the Moon and near Earth asteroids and the capture of solar energy to provide electric power on Earth could become successful businesses Most space activities have been pursued because they serve some utilitarian purpose whether increasing knowledge adding to national power or making a profit Nevertheless there remains a powerful underlying sense that it is important for humans to explore space for its own sake to see what is there Although the only voyages that humans have made away from the near vicinity of Earth the Apollo flights to the Moon were motivated by Cold War competition there have been recurrent calls for humans to return to the Moon travel to Mars and visit other locations in the solar system and beyond Until humans resume such journeys of exploration robotic spacecraft will continue to serve in their stead to explore the solar system and probe the mysteries of the universe ',\n",

astronauts survive in space Grades 3â 5 6â 8 9â 12 For centuries people have dreamed of leaving the Earth and traveling through space to visit the moon and explore other planets and stars Some of these dreams have become realities Spacecraft have orbited the Earth and sent back data to ground based scientists They have traveled to other planets and transmitted images and information that have helped to expand our knowledge of the solar system People have gone into space to orbit the Earth and even to visit the moon In 1992 a United States satellite the Cosmic Background Explorer COBE detected slight variations or ripples in the background microwave radiation coming from far out in space This information may be helpful in determining how the universe evolved Despite such achievements space exploration is still in its infancy considering the vast scope of the universe and the many unanswered questions about it For example scientists estimate that there are 10 billion stars like our sun in the Milky Way galaxy perhaps a million of which may have planets orbiting around them Scientists want to know if these planets exist and if they do are any of them like those in our solar system or do any harbor intelligent beings or other forms of life Someday as a result of space exploration and travel scientists may be able to solve the mysteries of the universe Their discoveries may also change our view of life on Earth and of our planet s role in the universe Before reaching space scientists had to solve the problem of escaping from the Earth s gravity the force that pulls objects toward Earth and prevents them from floating off into space A spacecraft leaving Earth must travel fast enough to overcome this strong gravitational pull The speed needed to overcome the Earth s gravity called escape velocity is about 7 miles 11 kilometers per second or 25 000 miles 40 000 kilometers per hour Reaching escape velocity does not mean that a spacecraft has freed itself completely from the Earth s gravitational pull which extends far out into space But it does mean that the spacecraft will not fall back to Earth even if no additional power is used As the spacecraft continues to move away from the Earth the gravitational force weakens until it no longer has a significant effect on the spacecraft For a spacecraft to enter orbit around the Earth it must reach a speed called orbital velocity The orbital velocity will depend upon how far above the Earth the craft is supposed to orbit For example a spacecraft must attain an orbital velocity of about 17 500 miles 28 000 kilometers per hour to orbit the Earth at a distance of 100 miles 160 kilometers A slower orbital velocity is needed to keep a spacecraft in orbit farther from Earth A spacecraft is sometimes put into a temporary or parking orbit before it is sent farther out into space There are two reasons for doing this A spacecraft launched directly into space would need more powerful more expensive rockets Scientists have also found that it is easier to aim a spacecraft toward its destination if it is put into a parking orbit first In space there are no fixed landmarks to indicate position Yet a spacecraft is expected to travel immense distances to its destination and perhaps land within a few hundred yards of a specific target Navigating a spacecraft to achieve this goal requires the help of many engineers and technicians and the use of complex equipment and systems Monitoring Systems and Crew Even during the quietest moments of a spaceflight many things are happening on board the spacecraft Doctors working with flight controllers must know such things as the breathing rate pulse rate blood pressure and body temperature of each crew member Ground based engineers need information about temperatures and pressures within the spacecraft the condition of its machinery and instruments and whether any dangerous situations may be arising Scientists need information about the characteristics of planets and their satellites such as data on their gravitational and magnetic fields and information on atoms and molecules in space Much of this data is gathered by devices called sensors which can detect and measure pressures temperatures radiation pulse rates and so on The measurements are changed into radio signals that are beamed back to scientists on Earth The technology concerned with systems that gather and send this information is called telemetry from Greek words meaning measuring at a distance On Earth people move about comfortably under the influence of Earth s gravity and they extract oxygen from the air to breathe The Earth s atmosphere protects them from deadly radiation and falling meteorites Earth also has abundant supplies of water which is necessary for survival When people venture into space however they leave the only known place where they can live naturally G Forces and the Human Body During the first few minutes after a spacecraft is launched an enormous force pushes astronauts down in their seats You may have felt this force although much more gently in a rising elevator As the elevator accelerates you can feel the pressure of the floor against your feet The force that holds you to the Earth and pulls you down is gravity The normal gravitational force that holds you to the Earth has a strength of 1 g The g stands for gravity The pull of 1 g on your body is what is commonly called your weight Suppose you stood on a scale inside an elevator as it accelerated upward You would find that you had suddenly gained a few pounds This is because gravity pulls you down and causes your body to resist being moved upward This resistance has the effect of making you slightly heavier The g force on your body would be a little greater than the normal 1 g On early spaceflights g forces built up to 10 g as the spacecraft accelerated during launch and also reached very high levels when the spacecraft slowed down Care had to be taken to prevent these high g forces from injuring the astronauts Scientists learned that astronauts can withstand up to 10 g for about two minutes without harm if they are lying down and facing in the same direction as the spacecraft is moving Their bodies must also be trained to withstand the strain Aboard the U S the g forces are never greater than 3 g Since this is well within the physical limitations of most people it allows individuals who have not had special training to go into space It also allows the space shuttle to carry equipment that would be damaged by high g forces Weightlessness and Its Effects By the time a spacecraft reaches escape velocity or orbital velocity there are no more high g forces In fact even Earth s 1 g force is gone As a result people aboard the spacecraft experience weightlessness or zero gravity 0 g a state in which they feel absolutely no gravitational pull In a state of weightlessness people feel lighter than a feather and float because they weigh nothing at all Several things are usually done to help crew members deal with weightlessness Lines are strung in the spacecraft cabin so that crew members can pull themselves along in the directions they want to go The soles of shoes and the floor of the cabin are covered with a special burrlike fabric that will stick to another similar surface It is very similar to the Velcro that is used today as a fastener for clothes This fabric enables crew members to walk around inside the spacecraft cabin during weightlessness Astronauts are also carefully trained to live in weightless conditions They learn how to move eat drink and handle tools They also learn how to sleep in a floating position held in place in a type of sleeping bag attached to the walls of the spacecraft During periods of weightlessness it is very important for astronauts to do certain exercises or there may be damage to their hearts blood vessels bones and muscles which are all adapted to the gravity of Earth Astronauts who spend a few months in weightless conditions do not seem harmed but doctors are concerned about the possible effects of weightlessness during long voyages if muscles and other bodily systems are not utilized as they are on Earth Space Sickness One problem that affects many astronauts is space sickness a violent motion sickness characterized by nausea headaches sweating and vomiting Space sickness is apparently caused by the absence of gravity In the weightless environment the brain does not seem to be able to cope with the conflicting messages it receives from the eyes and the balance organs in the inner ear As a result a person s equilibrium or sense of balance is disrupted After a few days the body adapts to the weightless environment but during the first few days of spaceflight space sickness can make astronauts very uncomfortable In many instances certain drugs and mental training have been able to control the symptoms of space sickness Life Support Systems On Earth every time you take a breath fresh air is pushed into your lungs That could not happen in space because there is no air and no air pressure to make air move Instead space is an almost perfect vacuum an empty area with no air or atmosphere Because of this vacuum astronauts need special life support systems to survive One type of life support system is the pressurized space suit This suit maintains proper air pressure and temperature and also supplies oxygen for breathing It is made out of many layers of strong synthetic materials that can protect an astronaut from the vacuum of space and other dangers such as radiation A pressurized space suit is bulky however and it is uncomfortable and tiring to be inside one for very long Therefore scientists have created ways to provide a shirtsleeve environment for astronauts when they are inside the spacecraft In this environment the cabin is pressurized and its air is conditioned to protect astronauts from the extreme cold of space the heat of the sun and the heat of re entry into the Earth s atmosphere The cabin s air conditioning system also purifies the air removes moisture and carbon dioxide from the air and adds fresh oxygen to it Within the cabin crew members wear light comfortable space suits that allow great freedom of movement and that can be pressurized quickly in an emergency When astronauts leave the shirtsleeve environment of the cabin they must wear pressurized space suits and carry portable life support systems The Apollo astronauts who walked on the moon for example wore backpacks with special equipment that could keep them alive for up to four hours An astronaut s backpack contains a small air conditioning system and a small battery to supply power Oxygen for breathing and for pressurizing the space suit is stored in a small tank within the backpack A ventilating system forces oxygen through the space suit and the pack and removes carbon dioxide and other contaminants as well as perspiration Several radio transmitters in the backpack make up a communications system One transmitter permits crew members to talk to each other and to ground controllers on Earth Other transmitters relay information about the physical condition of the person wearing the space suit and about the oxygen supply the pressure and temperature within the suit and the strength of the battery in the backpack Food Water and Wastes The food that astronauts eat on board a spacecraft must be nutritious easy to eat and convenient to store Most ordinary foods are too bulky and heavy to take on a spaceflight and many spoil if they are not refrigerated Some foods used in space are dehydrated and freeze dried which is a process that removes water leaving only a dry powdery or pastelike substance Freeze dried dehydrated foods weigh as little as one tenth of their original weight They take up very little space and can be kept in plastic bags at room temperature without spoiling Before eating the freeze dried food an astronaut adds some water to the dry food while it is in the plastic bag and mixes the contents until the food is soft The food can then be squeezed out of the bag or sometimes eaten with a spoon Astronauts sometimes warm up frozen and chilled foods as well Astronauts must have water for drinking washing themselves and preparing freeze dried foods On long trips devices called fuel cells are used to produce pure fresh water They also produce electricity for the spacecraft When oxygen and hydrogen are piped into the fuel cells the two gases combine forming water Electricity is produced during this reaction A special problem during spaceflight is how to deal with bodily wastes such as perspiration urine and solid waste Liquid wastes such as perspiration and urine are processed in a special purifying system that separates the water from the other materials in the wastes and purifies the water so it can be used again Solid waste materials are stored in plastic bags that are discarded after returning to Earth Space Food in the Future A trip to Mars will take about two and one half years Although this is a long time space travelers will probably carry processed food and use chemical purifying systems for atmosphere and water For longer trips on board space farms will probably be developed to provide most of the food needed The biological processes of growing plants could also be used to purify water and the spacecraft s atmosphere A space station 40 feet 12 meters long and 14 feet 4 meters across could house a farm large enough to support a crew of four Astronauts in space face a number of dangers quite unlike the dangers on Earth One of the most obvious dangers is the lack of atmosphere in space and the vacuum that exists there Without life support systems astronauts would be quickly killed by the space environment Space holds other dangers as well including the physical and emotional stresses of spaceflight itself Physical and Emotional Stress The environment aboard a spacecraft can be physically and emotionally stressful Spacecraft are rather small and there is little room for astronauts to move around or to have any real privacy In a spacecraft environment astronauts are also deprived of many of the emotional physical and sensory stimulations they experience in their lives on Earth Astronauts must also cope with the constant worry of life threatening dangers to themselves and the spacecraft Such conditions can be very stressful and can lead to conflicts among crew members impaired judgment and actions and behaviors that could endanger lives While short missions do not pose a problem long missions might cause tremendous stress Early spaceflights lasted only a few hours or a day and stress was not a serious problem Scientists were not sure however how astronauts would react to longer flights To find out they developed special test chambers to imitate the conditions in a spacecraft Volunteers lived and worked in these test chambers for long periods of time while scientists carefully observed them and kept records of their reactions These tests helped scientists improve the methods of choosing and training astronauts Several other things can be done to reduce the stresses of spaceflight Spacecraft cabins can be designed to allow privacy and provide room for recreation and exercise Private spaces can be personalized Astronauts can be given plenty of opportunities to rest to engage in enjoyable activities and to communicate with loved ones back on Earth Such measures can be quite effective in reducing levels of stress Dangers from Micrometeoroids Space is not completely empty Floating around in it are countless tiny particles of solid matter called micrometeoroids Although most of these particles are much smaller than grains of sand they move through space at tremendous speeds from 70 000 to 160 000 miles 112 000 to 258 000 kilometers per hour Space is so vast that micrometeoroids are widely scattered throughout it even though there are billions of them Usually micrometeoroids pose no great danger to a spacecraft Sometimes however they occur in great swarms A spacecraft traveling through a swarm may be hit by some particles which could puncture the skin of the spacecraft While tiny puncture holes may not be dangerous a larger hole could allow air to escape from the spacecraft cabin and cause the air pressure to decrease quickly If too much air escaped and the air pressure decreased enough breathing would become impossible While such an accident is unlikely astronauts are trained to respond almost automatically Helmets are snapped into place space suits are pressurized and the oxygen supply is turned on Safe within their space suits the astronauts can devote their attention to repairing the damage to the spacecraft Danger from Radiation In addition to micrometeoroids space contains tiny invisible particles of matter known as radiation that are emitted by the sun and other stars These radiation particles travel at speeds ranging from 1 million miles 1 6 million kilometers per hour to many times faster There are many types of radiation including X rays ultraviolet rays gamma rays radio waves and infrared rays Radiation can be very dangerous to life Exposure to some radiation can cause physical illness and other serious health problems Exposure to large amounts of radiation can cause death On Earth the atmosphere surrounding the planet acts as a filter to prevent most harmful radiation from reaching us The radiation that gets through the atmosphere is weakened enough to make it relatively harmless In space however there is no atmosphere to filter out harmful radiation particles Surrounding the Earth are two regions of strong radiation discovered in 1958 by the American scientist James A Van Allen Known as the Van Allen belts they are doughnut shaped and one lies inside the other They begin about 400 miles 640 kilometers above the Earth and extend outward for about 12 000 miles 19 000 kilometers The early spaceflights did not go far enough into space to reach the Van Allen belts but scientists planning the Apollo moon missions had to consider the danger from these belts There was less danger than had been feared Apollo 8 which carried the first astronauts to orbit the moon was launched directly through the Van Allen belts However the thickness of the spacecraft s skin and the metals used in its construction helped shield the astronauts from radiation The spacecraft also moved very fast so it was in the heavy radiation zone for only a short time Another radiation danger results from solar storms on the surface of the sun During these storms great eruptions of energy called solar flares sometimes burst out from the sun causing unusually intense radiation to spread outward in space Astronauts who are exposed to this radiation especially those working outside a spacecraft are in serious danger Protecting them against intense radiation requires the development of some type of heavy shielding But even with the best shielding some radiation might still harm them Some scientists propose using intense electromagnetic fields that could shield astronauts by pushing radiation away Fortunately the most severe solar flares usually occur during the active parts of an eleven year solar cycle and the worst radiation occupies only a portion of the space around the sun Many space missions in the future will depend on a permanent station orbiting high above the Earth In 1998 the United States in partnership with 15 other countries Russia Canada Japan eleven European nations and Brazil began assembling the International Space Station or ISS It was the largest science project ever undertaken costing 60 billion and taking an expected five years to complete Plans called for a station powered electrically by an array of solar panels as wide as a football field with living and working quarters as large as the combined cabin size of two 747 jetliners enough for a crew of up to seven scientists and astronauts The first two pieces or modules of the space station were carried into orbit one by the U S shuttle Endeavour and the other by a Russian rocket Shuttle astronauts started assembling the modules in space in what would be a series of missions to build the station piece by piece They and future space construction workers will rely on various tools developed for the shuttles such as the Remote Manipulator System a robotic arm that moves objects in and out of the shuttle s cargo bay and the MMU manned maneuvering unit that allows shuttle astronauts to fly and work in space without using a tether connected to a spacecraft The construction of an orbiting station will provide experience that can then be used in building lunar landing bases or research stations on the moon or on another planet A space station also will provide an opportunity for astronauts and scientists to live and work in space for long periods of time testing the long term effects of weightlessness and exposure to the environment of outer space This ambitious project is not the first space station to orbit the Earth The first experimental space station Salyut 1 was launched by the former Soviet Union in 1971 Several teams of cosmonauts visited the station and conducted experiments The Soviet Union put several other small space stations in orbit as well including other Salyut stations and the Mir space station Cosmonauts aboard the Mir set the record for the longest time human beings have remained in space The first U S space station to orbit the Earth was Skylab launched in 1973 Several crews visited and worked in Skylab before it re entered the Earth s atmosphere and disintegrated in 1979 Skylab provided information and experience that helped make many subsequent U S space shuttle flights successful One of the central quests of space exploration is to discover whether life exists anywhere else in the solar system Life as we know it has evolved on Earth because the planet lies at just the right distance from the sun to allow water to remain liquid and temperatures to be moderate Without these two conditions life forms as we know them could not exist Among the planets Mars appears to be the most hospitable to life although it is farther from the sun and much colder than Earth Mars has some water frozen in polar ice caps and perhaps in its soil much like the permafrost in Earth s arctic lands Mars also has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide Scientists think that long ago the planet may have had sufficient amounts of atmosphere and surface water to support life Although studies of the planet s surface have not revealed any signs of life future probes will no doubt look for remnants of life at the sites of Martian lakes that no longer exist Some scientists believe that remnants of Martian life may have already been found in several meteorites thought to have come from Mars and crashed on Earth In the late 1990 s NASA scientists discovered tiny wormlike features resembling fossilized bacteria in meteorites found in Antarctica Egypt and India The meteorites varied in age from 4 billion years to 165 million years suggesting that life once existed and perhaps still exists on the red planet Other researchers were skeptical arguing that the microscopic features might not be signs of life at all The debate will no doubt continue until more convincing evidence can be found in samples of Martian soil brought back to Earth by future space probes Another possible candidate for life in the solar system appears to be Europa Jupiter s large ice covered moon Scientists think that some form of life could exist under Europa s ice just as it does in frozen lakes of Antarctica In the late 1990 s the Galileo space probe found signs of ice that had melted and shifted indicating warm slush or even liquid water beneath Europa s cracked icy surface Some scientists speculate that a gravitational tug of war exerted by Jupiter and its other moons could keep large parts of Europa s ocean liquid If that is so then Europa may harbor some form of marine life perhaps similar to creatures found thriving around hot deep sea vents on Earth Future space probes designed to peer below Europa s surface using ice penetrating radar may offer further clues Sometime in the future it is possible that we will establish permanent bases on the moon or perhaps Mars The moon is the most likely site because it is close to Earth and its weaker gravity would allow spacecraft to use less fuel when taking off from its surface The moon s surface also contains various mineral resources that could be used in building a base In 1998 the space probe Lunar Prospector in orbit above the moon s poles found signs of frozen water the raw material from which hydrogen fuel and breathable oxygen could be extracted and used by future lunar colonists If we establish bases on the moon these bases will be excellent sites for astronomical research The far side of the moon for example would be ideal for telescopes because there would be no glare from the sun and no atmospheric distortion With near perfect viewing conditions astronomers could search for planets around other stars in the galaxy conduct long term studies of stars and other distant objects and look much farther into space than with any Earth based telescopes The moon would also be an ideal site to listen for radio signals that might come from intelligent life elsewhere in the universe Much farther in the future lies the possibility of voyages to other stars With current methods of rocket propulsion however a trip to the nearest star would take many more years than exist in a person s lifetime Space travel within our Milky Way galaxy therefore will probably require spaceships to be colonies with generations of inhabitants whose entire lives will be spent on board the space colonies as they travel on their journeys Given enough time and advances in technology it might even be possible to colonize other parts of the galaxy In the 1990 s scientists began discovering evidence of planets orbiting other stars beyond our own It may also be possible to build floating space colonies around nearby stars These colonies would be located in regions of space near enough to a star so that there would be enough light heat and solar energy for human beings to survive More practical than colonies far out in space would be an orbiting space colony near the moon with room for 10 000 people The colony could be built of lunar material which would be easy to transport from the moon s surface because the weak gravitational force would allow rockets to take off easier than they can on Earth Solar energy would supply an unlimited amount of power to the colony While exciting to contemplate centuries long space voyages bases on the moon and human colonies in space will not come about for many years However space tourism has become a reality In 2001 American businessman Dennis Tito became the first civilian to pay for a trip into space He joined a Russian crew on an eight day mission to the International Space Station Others lined up immediately for their turn in space Achievements in space have been truly remarkable Yet the future may hold even greater triumphs The day may come when human beings explore and inhabit the distant reaches of space and unravel the mysteries of the universe and of life within it Peter W Waller Ames Research

       " ' This is starting out as a complicated season for leaf peepers As the East Coast sweated through record October heat parts of the Rockies were buried under wildly early snow Late heat and

pigment that turns leaves green and allows trees to harvest light to make food sugars At the same time trees manufacture carotenoid a yellow to orange pigment that is masked by the green chlorophyll during the summer months When the production of chlorophyll slows with the onset of fall the carotenoidâ s bright color can emerge This yellow pigment also helps the leaf absorb different wavelengths of light that the green chlorophyll cannot The doâ s and donâ ts of traveling during the fall Certain species begin to produce another pigment anthocyanin when the seasons begin to change That is what turns forests red and orange Anthocyanin is also responsible for the red purple black and blue colors in certain foods high in antioxidants â think raspberries purple cauliflower and black rice This crimson pigment allows trees to continue storing just a little more sugar and nitrogen to have on hand for the next year according to Paul Schaberg a research plant physiologist with the U S Forest Service Some areas of the country are more likely to experience those bright red and orange leaves than others New England is a perennial fall destination because of its abundance of tree species contributing bright colors Schaberg points out that the best color displays occur in forests that have a diversity of species and trees that have the tendency to turn red The progression of fall creates a wave of color across the country with grassy plains and farmlands in the Midwest drying up and the trees of the East Coast rolling from green to yellow orange red to brown Descartes Labs collected and analyzed 10 years of satellite imagery to develop this cloud free animation of fall in the eastern United States NASA s two MODIS satellite instruments collected all of the imagery that

Western U S forests are predominantly evergreen where species of juniper spruce and fir are better adapted to the more extreme temperature and moisture shifts The deciduous trees in the West including aspens tend to display strong yellows But in some places such as near Provo Utah the aspens are known to show red and orange leaves as well This could be because of a few different factors Sometimes carotenoid pigments can at times appear orange think carrots But all deciduous trees have the ability to produce anthocyanins that create a red color and trees that are typically known to have yellow leaves in the fall can begin producing anthocyanin if the trees are experiencing more stress and find it physiologically beneficial to produce the pigment Provo Peak Aspens fire up the mountains with

is scientist speak for random nature of when fall colors occur â makes it a more interesting challenge if youâ re trying to do leaf peeping â according to Schaberg Moderate stress such as changing seasonal temperatures and the amount of daylight helps induce the onset of leaf color change but more severe stress can mute the vibrancy of autumnâ s palette Drought causes tree leaves to close up their pores to retain water limiting their ability to produce sugars and leading the tree to jettison the leaves Too much water can promote fungal pathogens that can infect leaves which can also lead to early leaf drop Folger can tick off a few years that were very disappointing for fall colors in New England in particular â 2005 2011 2017 â Folger recalls without pause â Itâ s almost cyclic â The first two years he cites were ruined by Hurricanes Katrina and Irene and the excessive moisture they brought to New England But this season is going to be lit both Poimiroo and Folger predict on both coasts This week the Eastern Sierras will continue to turn followed by color shows in Northern California Southern California and the urban forests Poimiroo says In New England low evening

       " ' Autumn leaf color is a phenomenon that affects the normal green leaves of many deciduous trees and shrubs by which they take on during a few weeks in the autumn season various shades of yellow orange red purple and brown 1 The phenomenon is commonly called autumn colours 2 or autumn foliage 3 in British English and fall colors 4 fall foliage or simply foliage 5 in American English In some areas of Canada and the United States leaf peeping tourism is a major contribution to economic activity This tourist activity occurs between the beginning of color changes and the onset of leaf fall usually around September and October in the Northern Hemisphere and April to May in the Southern Hemisphere A green leaf is green because of the presence of a pigment known as chlorophyll which is inside an organelle called a chloroplast When abundant in the leaf s cells as during the growing season the chlorophyll s green color dominates and masks out the colors of any other pigments that may be present in the leaf Thus the leaves of summer are characteristically green 6 Chlorophyll has a vital function it captures solar rays and uses the resulting energy in the manufacture of the plant s food simple sugars which are produced from water and carbon dioxide These sugars are the basis of the plant s nourishment the sole source of the carbohydrates needed for growth and development In their food manufacturing process the chlorophylls break down thus are being continually used up During the growing season however the plant replenishes the chlorophyll so that the supply remains high and the leaves stay green As autumn approaches with daylight hours shortening and temperatures cooling the veins that carry fluids into and out of the leaf are gradually closed off as a layer of special cork cells forms at the base of each leaf As this cork layer develops water and mineral intake into the leaf is reduced slowly at first and then more rapidly During this time the amount of chlorophyll in the leaf begins to decrease Often the veins are still green after the tissues between them have almost completely changed color Chlorophyll is located in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast and it is composed of an apoprotein along with several ligands the most important of which are chlorophylls a and b In the autumn this complex is broken down Chlorophyll degradation is thought to occur first Research suggests that the beginning of chlorophyll degradation is catalyzed by chlorophyll b reductase which reduces chlorophyll b to 7 hydroxymethyl chlorophyll a which is then reduced to chlorophyll a 7 This is believed to destabilize the complex at which point breakdown of the apoprotein occurs An important enzyme in the breakdown of the apoprotein is FtsH6 which belongs to the FtsH family of proteases 8 Chlorophylls degrade into colorless tetrapyrroles known as nonfluorescent chlorophyll catabolites 9 As the chlorophylls degrade the hidden pigments of yellow xanthophylls and orange beta carotene are revealed Carotenoids are present in the leaves throughout the year but their orange yellow colors are usually masked by green chlorophyll 6 As autumn approaches certain influences both inside and outside the plant cause the chlorophylls to be replaced at a slower rate than they are being used up During this period with the total supply of chlorophylls gradually dwindling the masking effect slowly fades away Then other pigments present along with the chlorophylls in the leaf s cells begin to show through 6 These are carotenoids and they provide colorations of yellow brown orange and the many hues in between The carotenoids occur along with the chlorophyll pigments in tiny structures called plastids within the cells of leaves Sometimes they are in such abundance in the leaf that they give a plant a yellow green color even during the summer Usually however they become prominent for the first time in autumn when the leaves begin to lose their chlorophyll Carotenoids are common in many living things giving characteristic color to carrots corn canaries and daffodils as well as egg yolks rutabagas buttercups and bananas Their brilliant yellows and oranges tint the leaves of such hardwood species as hickories ash maple yellow poplar aspen birch black cherry sycamore cottonwood sassafras and alder Carotenoids are the dominant pigment in coloration of about 15 30 of tree species 6 The reds the purples and their blended combinations that decorate autumn foliage come from another group of pigments in the cells called anthocyanins Unlike the carotenoids these pigments are not present in the leaf throughout the growing season but are actively produced towards the end of summer 6 They develop in late summer in the sap of the cells of the leaf and this development is the result of complex interactions of many influences both inside and outside the plant Their formation depends on the breakdown of sugars in the presence of bright light as the level of phosphate in the leaf is reduced 10 During the summer growing season phosphate is at a high level It has a vital role in the breakdown of the sugars manufactured by chlorophyll but in the fall phosphate along with the other chemicals and nutrients moves out of the leaf into the stem of the plant When this happens the sugar breakdown process changes leading to the production of anthocyanin pigments The brighter the light during this period the greater the production of anthocyanins and the more brilliant the resulting color display When the days of autumn are bright and cool and the nights are chilly but not freezing the brightest colorations usually develop Anthocyanins temporarily color the edges of some of the very young leaves as they unfold from the buds in early spring They also give the familiar color to such common fruits as cranberries red apples blueberries cherries strawberries and plums Anthocyanins are present in about 10 of tree species in temperate regions although in certain areas most famously northern New England up to 70 of tree species may produce the pigment 6 In autumn forests they appear vivid in the maples oaks sourwood sweetgums dogwoods tupelos cherry trees and persimmons These same pigments often combine with the carotenoids colors to create the deeper orange fiery reds and bronzes typical of many hardwood species The brown color of leaves is not the result of a pigment but rather cell walls which may be evident when no coloring pigment is visible 6 Deciduous plants were traditionally believed to shed their leaves in autumn primarily because the high costs involved in their maintenance would outweigh the benefits from photosynthesis during the winter period of low light availability and cold temperatures 11 In many cases this turned out to be oversimplistic other factors involved include insect predation 12 water loss and damage from high winds or snowfall Anthocyanins responsible for red purple coloration are actively produced in autumn but not involved in leaf drop A number of hypotheses on the role of pigment production in leaf drop have been proposed and generally fall into two categories interaction with animals and protection from nonbiological factors 6 According to the photoprotection theory anthocyanins protects the leaf against the harmful effects of light at low temperatures 13 14 The leaves are about to fall so protection is not of extreme importance for the tree Photo oxidation and photoinhibition however especially at low temperatures make the process of reabsorbing nutrients less efficient By shielding the leaf with anthocyanins according to the photoprotection theory the tree manages to reabsorb nutrients especially nitrogen more efficiently According to the coevolution theory 15 the colors are warning signals to insects like aphids that use trees as a host for the winter If the colors are linked to the amount of chemical defenses against insects then the insects will avoid red leaves and increase their fitness at the same time trees with red leaves have an advantage because they reduce their parasite load This has been shown in the case of apple trees where some domesticated apple varieties unlike wild ones lack red leaves in autumn A greater proportion of aphids that avoid apple trees with red leaves manage to grow and develop compared to those that do not 16 A trade off moreover exists between fruit size leaf color and aphids resistance as varieties with red leaves have smaller fruits suggesting a cost to the production of red leaves linked to a greater need for reduced aphid infestation 16 Consistent with red leaved trees providing reduced survival for aphids tree species with bright leaves tend to select for more specialist aphid pests than do trees lacking bright leaves autumn colors are useful only in those species coevolving with insect pests in autumn 17 One study found that simulating insect herbivory leaf eating damage on maple trees showed earlier red coloration than trees that were not damaged 18 The coevolution theory of autumn colors was proposed by W D Hamilton in 2001 as an example of evolutionary signalling theory 17 With biological signals such as red leaves it is argued that because they are costly to produce they are usually honest so signal the true quality of the signaller with low quality individuals being unable to fake them and cheat Autumn colors would be a signal if they are costly to produce or be impossible to fake for example if autumn pigments were produced by the same biochemical pathway that produces the chemical defenses against the insects citation needed The change of leaf colors prior to fall have also been suggested as adaptations that may help to undermine the camouflage of herbivores 19 Many plants with berries attract birds with especially visible berry and or leaf color particularly bright red The birds get a meal while the shrub vine or typically small tree gets undigested seeds carried off and deposited with the birds manure Poison ivy is particularly notable for having bright red foliage drawing birds to its off white seeds which are edible for birds but not most mammals The brilliant red autumn color of some species of maple is created by processes separate from those in chlorophyll breakdown When the tree is struggling to cope with the energy demands of a changing and challenging season maple trees are involved in an additional metabolic expenditure to create anthocyanins These anthocyanins which create the visual red hues have been found to aid in interspecific competition by stunting the growth of nearby saplings allelopathy 20 Although some autumn coloration occurs wherever deciduous trees are found the most brightly colored autumn foliage is found in the northern hemisphere including most of southern mainland Canada some areas of the northern United States Northern and Western Europe north of the Alps the Caucasus region of Russia near the Black Sea and Eastern Asia including much of northern and eastern China and as well as Korea and Japan 21 22 In the southern hemisphere colorful autumn foliage can be observed in southern and central Argentina the south and southeast regions of Brazil and southeastern Australia including Tasmania 23 Compared to Western Europe excluding Southern Europe North America provides many more arbor species more than 800 species and about 70 oaks compared to 51 and three respectively in Western Europe 24 which adds many more different colors to the spectacle The main reason is the different effect of the Ice ages while in North America species were protected in more southern regions along north south ranging mountains this was not the case in much of Europe 25 Global warming and rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere may delay the usual autumn spectacle of changing colors and falling leaves in northern hardwood forests in the future and increase forest productivity 26 Specifically higher autumn temperatures in the Northeastern United States is delaying the color change 27 Experiments with poplar trees showed that they stayed greener longer with higher CO2 levels independent of temperature changes 26 However the experiments over two years were too brief to indicate how mature forests may be affected over time Other studies using 150 years of herbarium specimens found more than a one month delay in the onset of autumn since the 19th century and found that insect viral and drought stress can also affect the timing of fall coloration in maple trees 27 28 Also other factors such as increasing ozone levels close to the ground tropospheric ozone pollution can negate the beneficial effects of elevated carbon dioxide 29 Typical fall foliage in red maple country in the Adirondack Mountains of Upstate New York English country lane in the autumn Autumn leaf color and Mount Fuji with snow seen from Lake Kawaguchi Japan Late autumn with brown dominating Autumn coloration at Karasawa of the Hodaka Mountains in Japan Autumn orange colors in Heinola Finland in October 2018 The town of Stirling South Australia located in the Adelaide Hills attracts many tourists during autumn A variety of colors around Tōfuku ji temple in Kyoto Japan Some trees such as this American sweetgum at

       " 'From lunar missions to anti asteroid defence systems there are plenty of exciting scientific developments to look forward to This year promises to be an important one for space exploration with several major programmes reaching the launch pad over the next 12 months The US is to return to the moon undertaking a set of missions intended to establish a lunar colony there in a few years China is expected to complete its Tiangong space station while Europe and Russia will attempt to land spacecraft on Mars having failed at every previous attempt India South Korea and Japan are also scheduled to put a number of missions into space Particular interest is going to focus on Nasa s mighty new space launch system SLS This is the most powerful rocket it has ever designed and has been built to carry astronauts to the moon and beyond as part of the agency s Artemis deep space exploration programme With these missions Nasa intends to reopen the solar system to investigation by humans rather than robot probes and regularly carry astronauts to the lunar surface The programme s first launch is scheduled for February when an SLS rocket standing more than 300ft high will carry an unmanned Orion capsule on a trajectory that will enter a highly elliptical orbit round the moon At its closest the spaceship will sweep within 62 miles of the lunar surface before soaring 40 000 miles above it a distance that will take it further from Earth than any spacecraft built for humans has ever flown Crucially Orion designed to carry between four and six astronauts when fully operational will be fitted with a European service module that will provide the capsule s power and propulsion for manoeuvring in orbit This will give its manufacturer the European Space Agency the opportunity to become a key partner in future Artemis missions If February s mission succeeds a crewed trip around the moon will take place in 2024 and this will be followed by a lunar landing in 2025 a gap of 53 years since Apollo 17 the last crewed moon mission touched down on the Taurus Littrow valley in December 1972 This time the crew will include at least one woman and the mission will mark the beginning of a programme aimed at establishing a lunar colony where astronauts would work on months long missions and develop technologies that could be used by future colonies on Mars A prime target for the first lunar outpost is Shackleton crater near the moon s south pole which is believed to hold reservoirs of ice Water will not only provide precious sustenance for astronauts it can be exploited as a source of hydrogen and oxygen by electrolysis that can be combined as rocket fuel As part of its preparations to establish a lunar colony Nasa will also start a massive programme of robot missions through the agency s 2 6bn commercial lunar payload services CLPS initiative This will involve sending a flotilla of robot spacecraft to the moon with the first missions beginning this year Built by private companies with Nasa backing these probes will attempt to map underground water deposits study the moon s deep interior and release robot rovers to investigate the lunar surface Fledgling space company Astrobotic will send its newly designed Peregrine lander to Lacus Mortis the lake of death a plain of basaltic rock in the north eastern part of the moon It will carry 11 different payloads of instruments and will be followed by another US company Intuitive Machines which is sending a spacecraft carrying six payloads to Oceanus Procellarum the Ocean of Storms A further 12 CLPS missions are scheduled for the next three years though head of Nasa science Thomas Zurbuchen has warned that these privately funded efforts each face a high risk of failure As many as half could go wrong he said recently For good measure Russia and India are both planning to launch their own lunar landers next year while South Korea is scheduled to place a satellite in moon orbit to study its mineral composition The hunt for alien life will take a step further this year with the launch of the joint European Russian ExoMars mission which will land a robot rover on the Oxia Planum a 125 mile wide clay bearing plain in the planet s northern hemisphere The rover named after Rosalind Franklin the British chemist and DNA pioneer will be fitted with a drill capable of probing several feet below the Martian surface where it is hoped primitive lifeforms may survive or at least the remnants of extinct organisms The 660lb rover was built by Airbus Defence and Space at the company s UK facility in Stevenage Launch is scheduled for 22 September and touchdown is expected on 10 June 2023 Hopes of success for the mission are guarded however as neither Russia nor Europe has had any luck in landing on Mars Nineteen Russian and Soviet missions and two European bids to land on the red planet have all failed including Europe s Schiaparelli lander which was intended to be a trial run for the current ExoMars mission but which crashed on the planet in 2016 Easily the most spectacular mission to the asteroids will be Nasa s bid to test an anti asteroid defence system for Earth Launched last year the double asteroid redirection test Dart spacecraft will crash into the moonlet Dimorphos in September Hurtling into its target at 15 000mph the 1 340lb probe the size of a small car will try to change the orbit of Dimorphos a lump of rock the size of a football stadium around its parent asteroid Didymos If successful Nasa and other space agencies will be encouraged to follow up the mission by developing craft that could deflect a larger asteroid heading towards Earth and so avert an Armageddon style impact say astronomers Should an asteroid the size of Dimorphos crash on Earth it would trigger an explosion equivalent to 400 600 megatonnes of TNT A city like Manhattan would be completely obliterated Elena Adams Dart s systems engineer told the journal Science This is to demonstrate a technique to save the world Nasa has plans for several other asteroid missions next year including the launch of the probe Psyche Scheduled for lift off in August the spacecraft will visit an asteroid called 16 Psyche that is thought to be the leftover core of a planet This vast chunk of nickel and iron is the remains of a violent collision with another astronomical object that stripped off the planet s outer layers and left its metallic innards exposed Studying 16 Psyche will give scientists an unprecedented opportunity to examine a planetary core It will also afford them a chance to explore a new type of world one that is made of metal Boeing will attempt to get its Starliner crew capsule into orbit so that it can begin to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station ISS A 2019 flight failed to reach the station and another attempt last year was called off at the last minute when fuel valves failed to open Boeing now plans to launch a crewless Starliner in early 2022 followed by a test flight with astronauts later in the year The capsule will then be used along with SpaceX s Crew Dragon spaceship on a rota to ferry astronauts to the ISS For its part China is expected to complete its space station Tiangong Heavenly Palace after launching the first of its three main modules Tianhe in April Modules Mengtian and Wentian will be added this year China has said it hopes to keep its space station which is considerably smaller than the ISS inhabited continuously by three astronauts for at least a decade A key task for crewmen will be to service the Xuntian space telescope which will be launched in 2024 and which will orbit in formation with the Tiangong station Fitted with a mirror roughly the same size as the Hubble space telescope Xuntian s tasks will include investigations of dark matter and dark energy as well as galaxy formation and evolution Blue Origin founded by Jeff Bezos and Virgin Galactic set up by Richard Branson both succeeded in launching maiden sub orbital flights last year and both say they expect to begin regular missions in 2022 offering groups of tourists a few minutes of weightlessness before returning to
